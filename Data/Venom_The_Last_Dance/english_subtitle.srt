1
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,473
I am Knull.

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,350
God of the void.

3
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,852
Slicer of worlds.

4
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,105
<i>Long ago,</i>

5
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>when light invaded my kingdom,</i>

6
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,319
<i>my symbiote children betrayed me</i>

7
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,531
<i>and imprisoned me here.</i>

8
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,455
At last,
a codex has been created.

9
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,750
It is the key to my freedom.

10
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,878
It will unlock this prison.

11
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:31,258
I order you to search
the corners of the universe

12
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,594
until you find this key.

13
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,931
Find me the codex.

14
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,565
And when I escape,

15
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,942
and annihilate
every living planet

16
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,071
and destroy
my symbiote offspring,

17
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,282
I will reward you...

18
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,617
with your lives.

19
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,822
<i>So you're saying
in this universe,</i>

20
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,741
<i>there's these superhero people.</i>

21
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,950
All right.

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,913
So tell me again
about your purple alien friend

23
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,956
who really loves stones.

24
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,876
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,

25
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,380
aliens, they do not love stones.

26
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,672
<i>- Eddie, don't start.</i>
- No.

27
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,133
No, they do not love stones.

28
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,131
Do you know what they love?

29
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,138
They love eating brains!

30
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,057
Because that's what they do.

31
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,395
<i>Señor,</i> he made
my family disappear.

32
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,604
For five years.

33
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,858
Five years, huh?

34
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,195
Well, that is a long time.

35
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,823
All right.

36
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>Eddie!</i>

37
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,326
<i>We are drunk!</i>

38
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>We're home!</i>

39
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,260
<i>I'm so done
with the multi-verse shit.</i>

40
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,971
<i>And I like our version
of the barman better.</i>

41
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,640
Ow. My head hurts.

42
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,142
I feel like I'm drunk,

43
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,561
but I'm also hungover
at the same time.

44
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,813
<i>Eddie! You want a Bloody María.</i>

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,481
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

46
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,070
- No.
- I don't want a drink.

47
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,118
Stop! You are destroying
this man's bar!

48
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,876
<i>Tequila!</i>

49
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,628
<i>I'm having the time
of my life, Eddie!</i>

50
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,465
I'd rather have
a glass of water.

51
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,883
<i>Be a man, Eddie.</i>

52
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,053
<i>We should've been a bartender!</i>

53
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,018
<i>- Tequila!</i>
- I did it.

54
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,144
I <i>did it.</i>

55
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,191
What the hell were those things?

56
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,902
I was born with them.

57
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,198
Freaking bar!
I'm done with this shit!

58
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,661
<i>This is Kelly Roulet
reporting from San Francisco.</i>

59
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,080
<i>Police are still
trying to locate</i>

60
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,850
<i>former reporter
Eddie Brock for questioning...</i>

61
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,083
Oh, no.

62
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,128
<i>...after the tragic death
of Detective Patrick Mulligan.</i>

63
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,338
No.

64
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,590
<i>Detective Mulligan
was found impaled</i>

65
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,176
<i>amidst a series
of bizarre happenings</i>

66
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,677
<i>at the city's cathedral.</i>

67
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,387
They think that I killed him.

68
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,515
<i>How long can he
evade authorities?</i>

69
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,016
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

70
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,435
<i>If we are on the news here,</i>

71
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,438
<i>we are on the news everywhere.</i>

72
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,816
Well, we can't go back
to San Francisco.

73
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,360
And I'm not staying down here,

74
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,154
hiding for the rest of my life
in Mexico, that's for sure.

75
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,447
<i>Where will we go?</i>

76
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,366
I don't know. I don't know.

77
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,538
Ooh.

78
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,499
That could work. Hey.

79
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,750
This judge got me

80
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,669
- kicked out of New York.
<i>- What a dick!</i>

81
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,380
Yeah, I still got a ton
of shit on him too.

82
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,925
<i>I've always wanted
to see the Statue of Liberty.</i>

83
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,177
Maybe we could blackmail him.

84
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,305
And clear my name.

85
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,390
<i>Let's go!</i>

86
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,685
<i>- Road trip!</i>
- Let's get the hell out of here.

87
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,396
<i>Keep the change!</i>

88
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,029
We keep our heads down,
and we keep moving.

89
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,909
<i>We are fugitives!</i>

90
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,453
<i>We are on the run!</i>

91
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,248
<i>Yes, we are innocent. Yes.</i>

92
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,502
<i>But I will eat every bad guy
that gets in our way.</i>

93
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,337
I need a Tylenol.

94
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,727
Do you hear that?

95
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,282
<i>Someone's in trouble.</i>

96
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,326
<i>And I need fuel for the road.</i>

97
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,410
Yeah, okay.

98
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,891
<i>That way.</i>

99
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,195
<i>Bad men, Eddie.</i>

100
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,033
<i>Are we the Lethal Protector,
or not?</i>

101
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,580
Do your thing.

102
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,706
<i>Easy-peasy.</i>

103
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,516
Jesus.

104
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,441
<i>Cute!</i>

105
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,235
<i>I promise not to eat it.</i>

106
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,114
They're fighting dogs.

107
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,200
<i>I draw the line
at fighting dogs, pal.</i>

108
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,418
<i>Oye, vato,</i>
you're in the wrong place.

109
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,962
Oh, hello.

110
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,547
This is our territory.

111
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,508
Well, I assume

112
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,343
by the threatening look
on your faces

113
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,263
that I ought to be scared, right?

114
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,893
But you took
the wrong path, <i>hermano.</i>

115
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,353
We can't let you leave.

116
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
I have a headache

117
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,193
on account of the fact
that I was drinking a lot.

118
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,278
I'm gonna be honest.

119
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,741
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

120
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,492
We all have monsters inside us.

121
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,369
Not like this.

122
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,955
So dark that it is highly likely

123
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,375
to tear your head off
and feed it

124
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,543
to your asshole.

125
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,420
<i>Orme! You can feed it to me!</i>

126
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963
Yeah, or I can feed it to him.

127
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,759
All right. Look. Come on.
I got a suggestion.

128
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,051
No. Stop speaking.

129
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,137
I'm not gonna stop speaking.
This is for you.

130
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,389
I'm doing this
for your benefit, all right?

131
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,892
I don't have to. Okay?
So pay attention.

132
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,162
We're gonna find all of these
dogs loving forever homes

133
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,521
because what you're doing
is reprehensible.

134
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,316
What does your mother
think of you, man?

135
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,318
My mother's dead, <i>culero.</i>

136
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,694
<i>You made it awkward!</i>

137
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,362
I'm sorry to hear that.

138
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,415
I'm giving you a chance.

139
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,793
Sweetie, I really am
giving you a chance.

140
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,169
You should probably take it.

141
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,302
<i>Say when.</i>

142
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,720
When.

143
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,190
<i>Hola,</i> bitches.

144
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,008
Who's a bad boy?

145
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,101
Now that's some sturdy footwear!

146
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,355
Where you going?

147
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,191
Home.

148
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,359
Nah.

149
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,994
What...

150
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,079
are you?

151
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,749
We are...

152
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,418
We are Venom!

153
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,086
We are...

154
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,796
- Venom!
- No!

155
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,214
- Oh!
- Yeah.

156
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,424
- We...
- We...

157
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,260
are Venom.

158
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,095
What?

159
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,182
We are totally gonna
need to work on that.

160
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,110
<i>That was delicious!</i>

161
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,945
You're welcome.

162
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,488
Thank you.

163
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>You take me
to all the finest places!</i>

164
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,118
Let's get the hell out of here.

165
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,494
Where's my shoe?

166
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,830
Oh, hey, buddy!

167
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,124
That's my shoe!
That's my shoe. That's my shoe!

168
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,792
Give me my shoe.

169
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,259
<i>These will fit.</i>

170
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,219
Now we are on the run

171
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,221
for something
we actually did do.

172
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,807
And I got stuck with a superhero
who can't fly.

173
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,892
<i>Wanna bet?</i>

174
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,086
There you are.

175
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,049
Get me General Strickland.

176
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,903
What the...?

177
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,871
Viral shedding.

178
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,833
These things wanna live.

179
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,094
Tell me about the man
who was just here.

180
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,893
He was acting, like, crazy.
Talking to himself.

181
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,062
What was he saying?

182
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,402
He had these big,
massive, wild arms.

183
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,862
They were bobbling like this.

184
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,365
Bring him.

185
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,446
<i>You think there are another
brother and sister</i>

186
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,637
<i>on one of those stars...</i>

187
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,058
looking at the same sky?

188
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,018
I'll be able to tell you
one day.

189
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,607
My twin brother...

190
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,567
a future NASA scientist.

191
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,111
One day.

192
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,909
When thunder roars,
head indoors.

193
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,719
No!

194
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,378
<i>He's on life support.</i>

195
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,797
<i>Get him
to emergency symbiosis now.</i>

196
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,603
It should be you.

197
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,416
<i>This just came across
our news desk</i>

198
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441
<i>and it bears repeating:</i>

199
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,945
<i>For all of you alien enthusiasts
out there, it's a sad day.</i>

200
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,949
<i>Washington has finally announced
the decommissioning of Area 51.</i>

201
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,659
<i>The controversial site is famous</i>

202
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,995
<i>for its alleged testing
on aliens.</i>

203
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,454
<i>In other news today...</i>

204
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,387
Right this way. Come on up.

205
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,238
- Strickland.
<i>- Strickland authorized.</i>

206
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,089
- It's finally happening, then.
- Yeah.

207
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,135
Yes, ma'am. Be nothing left
but rock and dust.

208
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,887
And roaches.

209
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,306
Even the biggest of bangs
couldn't kill 'em.

210
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,517
They've been around 280 million
years. And counting.

211
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,894
I did not know that, Dr. Paine.

212
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,277
Good to go.

213
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,904
- Have a good one, Gus.
- You too.

214
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,065
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

215
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,282
Morning, Dr. Paine,
we'll keep 'em safe for you.

216
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,301
I still don't think anyone
wants my old beater, Jim.

217
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,994
Never judge a book by its cover.

218
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,167
Early morning wake-up,
General Strickland.

219
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,586
Looks like
all your dreams came true.

220
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,839
I know how that must bug you.

221
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,050
He arrived shortly
before you did.

222
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,885
Did our new friend
give him any trouble?

223
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,721
You see,
that's exactly the problem.

224
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,805
What?

225
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,368
Your assumption
we're meeting friends.

226
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,102
- Morning.
- Good morning.

227
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,688
The bonding was successful.

228
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,897
I heard.

229
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,195
You always have this
look on your face

230
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,679
like something terrible
is imminent.

231
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,823
Because in my line of work

232
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,992
something terrible
<i>is</i> always imminent.

233
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,494
We contain them, you study them.

234
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,079
It's how it works.

235
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,504
Let's have a look.

236
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,340
- Hello, doctor.
- Morning.

237
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,592
His other symbiote
left him for dead.

238
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,304
<i>We saved him.</i>

239
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,555
He would have died.

240
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,435
Oh, try lowering those levels.

241
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,693
Morning, Sadie.

242
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,153
Let me get that.

243
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,905
We got this down in Mexico.

244
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,199
Hi. Welcome.

245
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,868
Any more on
where the rest of him is?

246
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,412
- We're gettin' there.
- Update me as you have it.

247
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,291
I don't get this obsession.

248
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,710
I told you.
My mom made me this pin.

249
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,878
It's July.

250
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,963
I'll see you in there.

251
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,467
Everyone on this side...

252
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,178
is weird.

253
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,721
Leave her alone, Rex.

254
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,808
God forbid anyone should
actually enjoy their work.

255
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,032
Area 51 will be
fully decommissioned

256
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,367
by the end of the week.

257
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,910
It's just a shipwreck anyway,

258
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,745
and they're tired
of the tourists.

259
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,164
But we don't exist down here.

260
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,624
A hundred feet subsurface...

261
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,252
undetectable to any human...

262
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,421
or nonhuman.

263
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,881
No one's phoning home from here.

264
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,341
My brother's greatest ambition

265
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,261
was to work up there at 51
doing what I do.

266
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,572
And I wish
I could have shown him

267
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,764
what we've built down here.

268
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,228
<i>You're okay.</i>

269
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:30,980
<i>Just...</i>

270
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,358
<i>try to breathe. Okay?</i>

271
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,445
When my brother and I were kids

272
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,948
they told us that UFOs were just
weather balloons, space trash.

273
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,243
Kubrick directed the moon
landing in a Hollywood studio.

274
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,454
Cool story.

275
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,539
Where are you going? This first.

276
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,332
Is there an increased risk
of exposure?

277
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,502
It's not us I'm worried about.

278
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,046
You know we carry all kinds
of viruses and bacteria

279
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,858
that could be harmful
to a sensitive lifeform.

280
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,426
And we don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

281
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,735
As long as we're keeping
the guests safe.

282
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,395
This is the first time
we've had a host

283
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,914
compatible with
one of our symbiotes.

284
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,857
And now we'll be able
to talk to one.

285
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,194
<i>Monsters.</i>

286
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,545
He's been experiencing panic
surges since we bonded him.

287
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,465
You try "Jingle Bells"?
So soothing.

288
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,675
Wow, why didn't I think of that?

289
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,012
Release him.

290
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,726
<i>Monsters.</i>

291
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,940
<i>I'm Dr. Paine. Teddy.</i>

292
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,526
You're safe here.

293
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,110
I'm going to help you.

294
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,655
Both of you.

295
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,659
The transfer was successful.

296
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,078
We had no choice.

297
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,788
We had to try and save you.

298
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,630
<i>Monsters.</i>

299
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,931
<i>You're broken too.</i>

300
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,941
<i>May I...?</i>

301
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,697
<i>May I ask you some questions?</i>

302
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,413
Is the symbiote
communicating with you?

303
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,250
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

304
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,130
Sound distresses them.

305
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,883
<i>Okay.</i>

306
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,598
<i>- Why are they here?
- What do they want?</i>

307
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,890
<i>Safe haven.</i>

308
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,601
<i>Safe haven?</i>

309
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,352
<i>We were running.</i>

310
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,646
<i>Is he talking
about the other symbiotes?</i>

311
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,148
<i>I think so.</i>

312
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,444
His creatures
search the universe for us.

313
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,904
<i>But we will be found.</i>

314
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,452
<i>And when we are,
he will kill us all.</i>

315
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,663
Who?

316
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,957
<i>There will be nothing left.</i>

317
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,460
<i>Here? On Earth?</i>

318
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,298
Why were they running?

319
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,761
<i>Because there is a dark,</i>

320
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,972
<i>cold sea</i>

321
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,350
<i>around this universe.</i>

322
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,851
<i>What is it?</i>

323
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,861
<i>You don't wanna know.</i>

324
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,831
<i>I've seen the future.</i>

325
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,768
<i>The darkness</i>

326
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:43,399
<i>has teeth.</i>

327
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,863
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

328
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,867
<i>We are currently cruising
at a comfortable 31,000 feet.</i>

329
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,662
<i>If you look out there
to your left just now,</i>

330
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,956
<i>you'll see the Grand Canyon.</i>

331
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,501
<i>Told you we could fly.</i>

332
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,961
Oh, my God!

333
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,337
<i>Direct to New York.</i>

334
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,297
My mouth is so dry!

335
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,049
<i>And we clear your name.</i>

336
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,218
It's so unpleasantly cold!

337
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,596
How does Tom Cruise do this?

338
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,640
<i>He doesn't whine
like a little bitch!</i>

339
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,862
<i>What was that?</i>

340
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,408
<i>What is that?</i>

341
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,201
Oh, fuck!

342
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,977
I'm sorry, Eddie,
but I got to disappear.

343
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,021
- What, now?
<i>- We're in deep shit!</i>

344
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,358
Why did you do that?

345
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,652
<i>I will explain.</i>

346
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,447
No! No!

347
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,911
No! No!

348
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,126
I'm gonna go ahead and say that

349
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,712
this is the shittest hangover
of all time.

350
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,089
<i>Look at it, Eddie.</i>

351
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,884
<i>Isn't it just astonishing?</i>

352
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,302
Oh, shut up.

353
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,055
<i>I don't think
I mind living here forever.</i>

354
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,558
We just came face-to-face
with a literal death machine.

355
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,186
Forever seems pretty optimistic.

356
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,195
<i>With the decommissioning
of Area 51, will the Pentagon</i>

357
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,906
<i>finally admit that
they've been holding UAPs?</i>

358
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,909
That's "unidentified aerial
phenomena" to you.

359
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,369
Yeah, Dad, we know.

360
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,121
What I wouldn't give to see
who built one of those things.

361
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,998
That's why we cashed in
our savings

362
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,959
and came on this
road trip, babe.

363
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,836
So you could finally
get to see...

364
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,003
That it's bullshit?

365
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,505
Yeah, well, what if I'm right?

366
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,173
Then I really hope
we don't end up

367
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,300
in an alien space lab
with probes up our asses.

368
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,344
Or dead.

369
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,679
"Asses."

370
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,190
Kicked up some gravel there.

371
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,192
- Hang tight, family.
- You good?

372
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,194
That was wild!

373
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,863
- Did the dog vomit?
- Yeah.

374
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,377
<i>Okay!</i>

375
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,795
<i>We've got this.</i>

376
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,214
<i>Soft landing. Bend your knees.</i>

377
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,383
<i>Engage your core.
Engage your core!</i>

378
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,554
<i>Yes! Yes, that's it!
Yes. That's it!</i>

379
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,058
<i>Well done.</i>

380
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,685
That was terrifying.

381
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,355
This is not New York.

382
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,940
No, this is a wasteland.

383
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,775
<i>I'm detecting
passive aggression.</i>

384
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:14,860
- Are you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

385
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,654
Oh, I'm sorry. How about
some <i>active</i> aggression?

386
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,699
You just threw me off a 757

387
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,826
without even
the slightest consideration

388
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,745
for my chronic vertigo.

389
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,622
It was an Airbus A320.

390
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,541
Was it? I am sorry. All right.

391
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,960
And what was that thing?

392
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,129
That thing
that we just juiced back there?

393
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,714
You're not going to like this.

394
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,592
No, I can absolutely guarantee
you that I'm not gonna.

395
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,238
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

396
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,181
That's er... You're being weird.
That's creepy.

397
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,016
That was a Xenophage.

398
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,100
A what?

399
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,852
A Xenophage.

400
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,979
- A symbiote hunter.
- Of course.

401
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,857
Problem is, if she has found
her way here,

402
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,484
others will soon follow.

403
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,735
"Others"?

404
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,530
The Xenophage's maker
also created us symbiotes.

405
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,157
So that's your sister?

406
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,494
All the symbiotes turned on him,
locked him up on Klyntar.

407
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,703
- Your planet.
- No!

408
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,455
- Not a planet.
- Not your planet.

409
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,499
A prison we built for him
to sleep...

410
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,459
- Of course.
- ...for eternity!

411
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,211
What's his name, then?

412
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,339
I didn't hear a word you said.

413
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,465
Knull.

414
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,716
- Knull.
- No!

415
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,468
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

416
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,473
This is serious, Eddie.

417
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,808
Let's just not talk.

418
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,852
Quiet.

419
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,318
What does this
Xyla-Xyn-Xyn-thingy,

420
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,278
this symbiote hunter,
want with you anyway?

421
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,949
It doesn't. It wants us.
We have something it needs.

422
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:48,745
We only have this shitty shirt,
we got one boot and sunburn.

423
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,455
And the codex.

424
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,665
The what, now?

425
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,125
I'll show you.

426
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,878
Damn it, what are you doing?

427
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,048
<i>Let's say you died.
I could bring you back to life.</i>

428
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,216
<i>Well, I like that.</i>

429
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,094
<i>But if I did,
our separate life forces</i>

430
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:09,057
<i>would become one single force
called a codex.</i>

431
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,934
<i>What the hell is a codex?</i>

432
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:15,230
<i>It's a key.
A key that unlocks a cage.</i>

433
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,940
<i>The prison on Klyntar.</i>

434
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,942
<i>It would free our creator.</i>

435
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,652
Well, thank God we haven't died.

436
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,237
<i>Yeah, except that one time.</i>

437
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,200
<i>Oh, no. No.</i>

438
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,453
<i>So you're telling me
we're carrying this thing.</i>

439
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,288
<i>That's why the Xenophage
is hunting us.</i>

440
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,582
<i>What do we do?</i>

441
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,167
<i>She can only see the codex</i>

442
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,295
<i>when a symbiote
is in its full true form.</i>

443
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,049
Right.

444
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:43,884
You mean you can't come out?

445
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,344
I can do this. I can do this.

446
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,680
But if I fully transform,

447
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,475
the codex sends her
a tracking signal.

448
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,311
She'll find us,
rip it out of our spine

449
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,063
and free Knull from Klyntar.

450
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,689
So how do we
get rid of this codex?

451
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:02,694
As long as you and I both live,
the codex exists.

452
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,613
- If one of us should die...
- No.

453
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,739
...the codex would die.

454
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,699
- That's not gonna work for me.
- Nor me!

455
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,786
That Xenophage was fast.

456
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,621
It won't take long
for the feds to tie us

457
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,582
to those four headless bodies
we left in Mexico.

458
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,585
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we better go.

459
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,175
<i>Four legs are better than one.</i>

460
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,094
Be honest with me, buddy.

461
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,098
How fast do you think
you can get that thing to go?

462
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,599
Without killing it.

463
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,934
<i>Only one way to find out.</i>

464
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,730
<i>Don't scare him.
Don't scare horsey-horsey-horse.</i>

465
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,734
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

466
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:43,944
Hey.

467
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,487
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

468
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,865
<i>Surprise, horsey!</i>

469
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,493
<i>I love horsey!</i>

470
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,086
Let's go.

471
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,423
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

472
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,389
<i>Ride me, cowboy!</i>

473
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,432
You are an asshole!

474
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,601
I swear to God,
when I get off this horse,

475
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,436
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you mother...

476
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,613
<i>Now that's horsepower!</i>

477
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:44,880
<i>Safe haven?</i>

478
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,924
No. They're not here
for a safe haven.

479
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,303
How about a new home?
Evict the current tenants.

480
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,598
I think you've watched too many
alien invasion movies, Rex.

481
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,518
Have I?

482
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,235
They were running.
That's what he said.

483
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,029
Don't kid yourself.

484
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,780
They were always migrating.

485
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,408
<i>A meteor carrying symbiote life</i>

486
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,244
<i>crashes on Earth,
and they all survive.</i>

487
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,537
<i>Coincidence?</i>

488
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,872
<i>Give me a break.</i>

489
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,541
All right.

490
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,419
Let's go get 'em.

491
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,422
You're so desperate to believe

492
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,424
that they're here
for altruistic reasons.

493
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,052
Makes you dangerous.

494
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,231
We just intercepted
an emergency call

495
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,690
from an Airbus out of Mexico

496
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,193
saying a man jumped
off the plane over Sequoia.

497
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,153
We'll take the Osprey.

498
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,197
Eyes wide, Paine.

499
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,917
I can't feel my balls.

500
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,880
That was horrible.

501
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,314
<i>Visual on suspect.</i>

502
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,568
Take him out.

503
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,030
- Collect the symbiote.
<i>- Team Six engaged.</i>

504
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,543
<i>Disengage harness. Let's go.</i>

505
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,139
<i>No! The codex!</i>

506
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,682
Can't let you die.

507
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,037
Where did that come from?

508
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,718
<i>- Morph!</i>
- Copy.

509
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,520
<i>- Time to go!</i>
- Hell yeah!

510
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,101
What happened?

511
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,644
<i>There's something else out here.</i>

512
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,813
- Something else?
<i>- He said this would happen.</i>

513
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,565
I just lost three people.

514
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,233
Can you collect any samples?

515
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,028
Samples?

516
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,884
Those were not feds.

517
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,136
Those were some
special forces shit.

518
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,430
<i>- They were trying to kill us.</i>
- Yeah.

519
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:31,142
Yeah, great. Great.
So now we have the cops,

520
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,519
the United States Army

521
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:36,397
and some creature
from hell hunting us.

522
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,318
Oh, God, I just saw
blood mist spray

523
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,529
out of the back
of an alien's face.

524
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,831
I killed someone.

525
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:56,084
<i>They didn't give you a choice.</i>

526
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,962
<i>You</i> didn't give me a choice.

527
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,255
<i>I couldn't get to you.</i>

528
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,424
Not in the rapids. A year ago
when you stole my life.

529
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,301
<i>We've been together
for a whole year?</i>

530
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,345
A year too long.
Just stay hidden

531
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,514
while we get to New York
without getting killed.

532
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,735
We need you to come out.

533
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,033
The thing you talked about,
the creature...

534
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,743
It's here.

535
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,665
It killed some people.

536
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,398
Wow.

537
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,777
He's so beautiful.

538
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,883
<i>I sense...</i>

539
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,304
<i>I sense my own.</i>

540
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:39,479
<i>And yet,</i>

541
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:44,484
<i>the one Knull seeks is not here.</i>

542
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,864
<i>What does he seek?</i>

543
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,078
<i>The black one.</i>

544
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,996
<i>Brock's symbiote?</i>

545
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,458
He's the only one
who carries a codex.

546
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:06,631
<i>The end is Knull.</i>

547
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,890
You need your suit.

548
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,393
Still worried
about giving this thing a cold?

549
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,480
<i>Venom carries the key
to Knull's freedom.</i>

550
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,108
He must never obtain it.

551
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,609
<i>Or your race will be killed.</i>

552
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,153
<i>You.</i>

553
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,323
And you.

554
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,075
<i>And...</i>

555
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,577
you.

556
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,624
<i>Everyone, everything.</i>

557
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,001
<i>How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?</i>

558
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,795
<i>You can't.</i>

559
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,590
<i>He's older than the universe.</i>

560
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,176
He needs the key.

561
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:57,557
<i>Then everything will end.</i>

562
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,854
<i>How do we stop him
from getting it?</i>

563
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:07,191
<i>If the symbiote
and the host are alive,</i>

564
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,112
<i>then the codex is alive.</i>

565
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,741
And if one of them dies?

566
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,701
The codex dies.

567
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,120
<i>The codex dies.</i>

568
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,416
- Rex, you can't be serious.
- Oh, I'm game.

569
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,293
Destroying the codex
is the only way

570
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,170
it remains unobtainable. Right?

571
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,107
<i>Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.</i>

572
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,340
Destroying it?

573
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,134
We have barely even
scratched the surface.

574
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,969
My people are dead.

575
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,348
Something is coming
that cannot be beaten.

576
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,577
I'm stopping
all this shit right now.

577
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,852
Science is sacrifice.

578
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,061
Teddy.

579
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,856
This is serious.

580
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,608
Listen to her.

581
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,447
Have you spoken
to your family recently?

582
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,409
Is everything okay?

583
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,623
Yeah.

584
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,462
<i>I smell wet dog. And sausamages!</i>

585
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,797
Hey, friend-o.

586
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,423
You okay, there?

587
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,427
No, I'm not okay.

588
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,347
It's pretty wild out there.

589
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,224
- I know.
- Yeah.

590
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,308
You hungry?

591
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,935
Yes.

592
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,019
Come over.

593
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,105
Thank you.

594
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,191
- So this is my wife, Nova Moon.
- Hi.

595
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,611
And these are my kids.
Echo and Leaf.

596
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,697
<i>- A lifetime in therapy.</i>
- Don't.

597
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:18,948
Huh?

598
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:24,203
Don't you dare! Wow.
How beautiful are your children.

599
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,414
And that's Blue.

600
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,542
- Who is a...
- Dog.

601
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,419
And I'm Martin.

602
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,296
- Hey, Martin.
- Hey.

603
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,380
I'm Eddie.

604
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,303
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- You too. Pleasure.

605
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:40,094
- Come, sit, please. Come on.
- Okay. Thank you.

606
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,430
Jesus Christ.

607
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,558
So, right.

608
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,854
So nothing died on that plate.
<i>Namaste,</i> man.

609
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,023
- Thank you.
<i>- Hard pass!</i>

610
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,650
Oh, dear.

611
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,612
- Eddie, where you headed?
- New York.

612
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,696
Oh, wow.

613
00:44:58,821 --> 00:44:59,822
- Yeah.
- All right.

614
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,867
Long way to New York
with naked shrimps, man.

615
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,410
Yeah.

616
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,662
We could ride you out to Vegas.

617
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,788
Yeah.

618
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,249
<i>These people are weird,
I'm telling you.</i>

619
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,560
That would be so kind.
Thank you.

620
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,585
You're welcome.

621
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,086
Of course.
Life's one big adventure.

622
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,570
Who doesn't love
making new friends?

623
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,797
- Right?
- Right?

624
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,092
This guy is so one of those
serial killer hitchhikers

625
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,303
from my favorite murder podcast.

626
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,221
Baby. Not now.

627
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,515
How has social services
not taken us away yet?

628
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,144
She... She... She's joking.

629
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,022
- I'm not.
- Please, honey.

630
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,150
So we're riding
the Extraterrestrial Highway.

631
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,485
- Yeah.
- The whatchamawhosit?

632
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,029
It's the road
that leads to Area 51.

633
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,448
See if we can spot us an alien

634
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,617
before they shut the place down
forever, you know?

635
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,744
It's my lifelong dream.

636
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,245
<i>We could show him right now!</i>

637
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,330
Not a believer?

638
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,459
Actually, Martin...

639
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,295
How do I put this?

640
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,715
I am.

641
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,052
Actually, I am a big,
big believer.

642
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,221
<i>- You're not that big.</i>
- Oh, you a comedian now?

643
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,431
No, actually, I was in IT.

644
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,557
- Were you?
- Yeah.

645
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,227
- That's so cool.
- Oh, thanks.

646
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,981
I hope you don't get
disappointed, you know?

647
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:19,276
And I hope that if you
do find one, I hope you meet...

648
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:23,906
a really good alien, not a...

649
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,993
not a bad...

650
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,245
one.

651
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,705
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

652
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,289
Well...

653
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:35,835
I know a dark force
when I see one, Eddie.

654
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,263
It's kinda hot in here.

655
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,098
Oh, you'll get used to it.

656
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,058
AC's really bad
for your health, you know.

657
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,770
All right. Family ready?

658
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,732
- Yup.
- Guest ready?

659
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,859
Let's rock this camper.

660
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:04,321
<i>Ground control to Major Tom</i>

661
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,241
<i>Oh, I love a singalong!</i>

662
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,952
<i>Ground control to Major Tom</i>

663
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,705
Shoot me in the face.

664
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,584
<i>Take your protein pills
and put your helmet on</i>

665
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,128
<i>- Oh, yeah! This is my jam!</i>
- Ten...

666
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,296
...nine...

667
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:23,883
<i>...eight, seven, six...</i>

668
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,926
<i>Commencing countdown, engines on</i>

669
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,470
<i>...five, four...</i>

670
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,764
...three, two, one.

671
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,350
<i>Check ignition
and may God's love be with you</i>

672
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,020
<i>Liftoff!</i>

673
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,439
- Come on, Eddie, sing along!
- I'm good, thanks.

674
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,690
You know the words!

675
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,442
Just think of this
as the tour bus.

676
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,128
We're the band,
and you can be the groupie.

677
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,362
<i>Come on! Don't be square.</i>

678
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,530
Don't get me started.

679
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,867
<i>This is Major Tom
to ground control</i>

680
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,954
<i>I'm stepping through the door</i>

681
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,876
<i>And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way</i>

682
00:47:58,959 --> 00:47:59,960
<i>Cheer up!</i>

683
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:04,799
<i>And the stars look
very different today</i>

684
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,050
Why?

685
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,053
<i>-For here am I</i>
-Why is this happening?

686
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,931
<i>-Sitting in a tin can
-Can made of tin!</i>

687
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:16,185
<i>Far above the world</i>

688
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,394
<i>Like a bathtub, Eddie.</i>

689
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,230
<i>Planet Earth is blue</i>

690
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:24,318
<i>And there's nothing I can do</i>

691
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,863
<i>This is ground control
to Major Tom</i>

692
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,615
<i>Sometimes I think we would</i>

693
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:32,368
<i>have been happier
with a life like this.</i>

694
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,329
<i>And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear</i>

695
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,622
<i>You know?</i>

696
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,541
Yep.

697
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,584
<i>Now it's time
to leave the capsule...</i>

698
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,170
- I know.
<i>- ...if you dare</i>

699
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,342
<i>This is Major Tom
to ground control</i>

700
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,970
<i>I'm stepping through the door</i>

701
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:57,309
<i>And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way</i>

702
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:02,982
<i>And the stars look
very different today</i>

703
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:08,571
<i>For here am I
sitting in a tin can</i>

704
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:13,742
<i>Far above the world</i>

705
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,151
You like chocolate?

706
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,821
They don't let us eat sugar.

707
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,365
They don't?

708
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:58,412
I have a friend
who loves chocolate. Thank you.

709
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,164
It's very kind of you.

710
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,920
I don't wanna see an alien.

711
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,254
You don't?

712
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,382
It's scary.

713
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,553
Okay.

714
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,556
Well, you know,
it's okay to be scared.

715
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,268
I'm scared, like...

716
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,354
like, all the time.

717
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,148
Promise I won't see one?

718
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:31,987
Buddy.

719
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,367
Aliens are not real.

720
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,660
Okay?

721
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,119
I promise.

722
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,039
Okay?

723
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,091
<i>You said the right thing.</i>

724
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,218
<i>You would make a good dad.</i>

725
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:11,068
<i>We've come a long way,
you and me.</i>

726
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,405
We have many more roads
to travel, buddy.

727
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,823
<i>Wouldn't that be nice?</i>

728
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,533
You say something?

729
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:23,414
No. Just dreaming, I guess.

730
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,590
That's the Nierika.

731
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,926
"Nierika"?

732
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,261
Yeah.

733
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,346
There's a doorway in our minds

734
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,932
that usually remains
hidden and secret

735
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,059
until the time of death.

736
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,439
Crazy things
in this world, Eddie.

737
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,068
You can see 'em if you're open.

738
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,030
Oh, I seen them.

739
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:02,578
<i>I'm glad we didn't
eat this fine family.</i>

740
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,193
Welcome to the city
of second chances.

741
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,128
Thank you, thank you.

742
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,797
Take care, buddy. Thank you.

743
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,090
Stay, Blue. Stay.

744
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,233
Thank you. Take care, Blue.

745
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,300
Vegas.

746
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,682
Listen, I just want you
to have this.

747
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,244
- Please. And...
- Oh, Martin, that's a lot of...

748
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,021
- Thank you.
- Quality support cushioning.

749
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,316
Plus, they come with
an antimicrobial footbed.

750
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,277
<i>No! Reject them.
Worse than Crocs.</i>

751
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,695
Thank you.

752
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:23,075
<i>Oh, baby, baby,
it's a wild world</i>

753
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,993
<i>But I'll always remember you</i>

754
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,290
Goodbye, Martin.

755
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,001
It's goodbye for now.

756
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,129
That's what I like to think,
Eddie.

757
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,881
Okay, bye.

758
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,174
Hey, Martin.

759
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,095
You know that doorway...

760
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,721
The Nierika?

761
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,849
Yeah. It's open.

762
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:49,101
All right? Just...

763
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,186
Be safe.

764
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,148
Okay.

765
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,233
Thanks.

766
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,867
Oh, Jesus.

767
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,454
Well, this is an all-time low.

768
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,630
<i>You have chocolate!</i>

769
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,009
<i>Yum!</i>

770
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:35,230
<i>I would like to see her
when we get to New York, Eddie.</i>

771
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,107
You know, she was built

772
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,651
to welcome visitors
to America, buddy.

773
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,153
And that's you.

774
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,030
<i>You think so, Eddie?</i>

775
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,490
Oh, yeah. I know so.

776
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,242
When we get out of this mess,
we'll go see her.

777
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,161
We'll say, "Hi, Lady Liberty."

778
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,788
<i>And see a Broadway show!</i>

779
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:52,956
Yeah, sure.

780
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,041
<i>Wow!</i>

781
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,044
<i>I know how much
you hate musicals.</i>

782
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,506
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

783
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,523
<i>What's next, Thelma?</i>

784
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:18,941
Well, Louise,

785
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,194
I'm not sure 20 bucks
is gonna get us much

786
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,112
in the way of a motor transport.

787
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,618
And I'm not ever riding
an alien horse again.

788
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,371
So I guess it looks like
we're stealing cars.

789
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,997
<i>No, I've watched</i> Rain Man,

790
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,751
<i>and in my infinite wisdom
as a celestial being,</i>

791
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,670
<i>working the system is easy.</i>

792
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:44,007
<i>We hit the slots,
then blackjack, then roulette!</i>

793
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,342
<i>Bingo-bango!</i>

794
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,679
<i>Luxury ride,
Bluetooth sound system, AC</i>

795
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,223
<i>and the top down.</i>

796
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,559
<i>Because that's how we roll.</i>

797
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:55,602
Paris Casino
has a strict dress code.

798
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,692
No, you know what? It's a hotel.
These are my vacation clothes.

799
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,110
Get better ones.

800
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,237
<i>He's not wrong. Look at you.</i>

801
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,907
Don't push it, all right, buddy?

802
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,285
<i>- Want a hand?</i>
- Yes.

803
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,331
I didn't mean knock him out.
What are you doing?

804
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:18,125
<i>- He was being a dick.</i>
- Yeah, but...

805
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,876
<i>Oh! Look.</i>

806
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,923
<i>We need a disguise.</i>

807
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,468
What are we doing?

808
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,137
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

809
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,263
Hi.

810
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,183
Oh, God.

811
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,560
<i>Warm.</i>

812
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,401
Why do you keep
knocking people out?

813
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,902
What is wrong with you?

814
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,487
Jesus, why?

815
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,574
So sorry, buddy.

816
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,826
I am so, so sorry.

817
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,287
<i>Eddie! Yeah, baby.</i>

818
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,665
<i>Now no one will recognize us.</i>

819
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,750
<i>Seriously.</i>

820
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:04,880
<i>You could get voted</i>
People'<i>s Sexiest Man of the Year</i>

821
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,591
<i>if anyone cared
who you were anymore.</i>

822
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,593
I've won Sexy Man awards before.

823
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,719
<i>'Course you have.</i>

824
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,472
- Hey. Hey.
- Yeah?

825
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,723
The guy that did that?

826
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,351
I saw it.
He's in the arch over there.

827
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,769
- He's shitfaced.
- All right.

828
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,980
We are bad people.

829
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,649
<i>Yeah, we are!</i>

830
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,609
We're keeping these shoes,
by the way.

831
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,322
<i>We are so money, and we know it!</i>

832
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,782
Welcome to the Paris.

833
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,241
- Thank you.
- No, thank <i>you.</i>

834
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,452
- Just sit on the ground.
- What happened?

835
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,677
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

836
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,555
<i>Let me multiply that 20.
Let me quadruplify it.</i>

837
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:57,057
What are you doing?

838
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,768
No. This is all the money
that we have.

839
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,187
<i>Luck, be a lady tonight</i>

840
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,647
No.

841
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,443
<i>Smashing jacket!
Let's eat him and steal it!</i>

842
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,701
<i>I know Lady Luck
is on our side tonight!</i>

843
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,244
No, I would say that Lady Luck

844
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,037
is definitely
not on your side tonight.

845
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,289
In fact, I would even
go so far to say

846
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:23,375
that Lady Luck hates you, buddy.

847
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,294
<i>- I can't stop now!</i>
- Of course you can't stop.

848
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,421
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

849
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,648
<i>- It's like...</i>
- This feeling?

850
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,716
<i>It's like all of my problems
have gone away!</i>

851
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,884
Do this all the time!

852
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,598
<i>Eddie.</i>

853
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,392
<i>I need more money.</i>

854
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,063
But we don't have
any more money, buddy.

855
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,815
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

856
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,776
You are a sore loser.

857
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,319
<i>You're</i> a sore loser!

858
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,990
I think you broke my foot.

859
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,743
<i>Lady Luck is a fickle slut!</i>

860
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,746
<i>We should have played</i>
that <i>machine!</i>

861
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,249
No effing way.

862
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,878
Eddie Brock?

863
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,297
Mrs. Chen! That's not yours.

864
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:13,175
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Eddie! It's Mrs. Chen!</i>

865
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,676
Oh, Mrs. Chen!

866
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,802
Eddie, baby!

867
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,221
Mrs. Chen! Mrs. Chen! Mrs. Chen!

868
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,390
<i>- I'm gonna cry.</i>
- Me too.

869
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,019
Wow. What happened to you?

870
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,145
You look hot!

871
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,897
- So do you.
<i>- Really hot.</i>

872
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,356
- I <i>always</i> look hot.
- Yeah.

873
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,192
- Is the big guy in there?
- Yeah.

874
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,693
Do you like my dress?

875
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,278
I've been winning so big,
they gave me

876
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,589
a credit line
at the clothes store.

877
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,156
And then the penthouse suite!

878
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:40,494
Wow. You know I stole this suit
off a guy who pissed on me.

879
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,704
I knocked him out.
I left him in a bush.

880
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:44,664
Well, that explains the stink.

881
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,043
You could use my room
to clean up, and then we party.

882
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,711
Oh, that would be so good.

883
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,713
And room service.

884
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,216
<i>Yes!</i>

885
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,103
We got him.
Positive ID on Brock.

886
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:10,941
CCTV hit,
the Paris Hotel, Vegas.

887
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,527
- Have we reconstituted The Six?
- Yes, sir.

888
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,320
Put 'em in.

889
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,670
The Six are en route.

890
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,255
They'll bring him in.

891
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:38,385
At this time, I'm requesting
control of the Imperium Program.

892
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,806
You have my permission, general.

893
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,653
<i>When thunder roars,
head indoors.</i>

894
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,631
Let's dance, baby.

895
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,134
- No. No.
<i>- Yeah! I love dancing!</i>

896
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,803
Are you crazy?
That thing will find us.

897
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:22,971
Don't be a party pooper.

898
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,807
No! Do not encourage him.

899
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,933
You know what, Mrs. Chen?

900
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,685
We are fugitives.
We are on the run.

901
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,396
So, thank you for having us.
We gotta go.

902
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,647
<i>You're no fun!</i>

903
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,900
One last dance before you go.

904
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,026
<i>We never do anything</i>

905
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,235
<i>- I want to do.</i>
- What?

906
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,070
Just a little dance.

907
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:43,033
<i>And you gave away my chickens.</i>

908
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:45,660
Yeah!

909
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:54,169
Let's cut a rug, Mrs. Chen.

910
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,004
<i>I give up.</i>

911
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:09,893
<i>Oh, no, I cannot unsee that.
I cannot unsee that!</i>

912
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,690
<i>You can dance</i>

913
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,901
<i>You can dan...</i>

914
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,655
<i>Having the time of our lives</i>

915
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,580
<i>When did you two practice this?</i>

916
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:55,981
Goddammit!

917
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,267
<i>I told you this would happen!</i>

918
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,821
<i>Don't panic.
She can't see the codex.</i>

919
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,531
What the hell is that?

920
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:06,658
Wow. So ugly!

921
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:10,036
Stay very calm.

922
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,038
She can't see the thing
she's looking for.

923
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:22,716
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

924
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,308
<i>Target acquired.</i>

925
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,102
- You leave Eddie alone!
<i>- Silence!</i>

926
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,355
My shoes.

927
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,024
<i>Go. Move out, move out!</i>

928
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,011
Wow.

929
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,099
Area 51.

930
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,851
Yeah.

931
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,186
Yeah.

932
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,272
We made it.

933
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,194
You finally got to see it, Dad.

934
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,863
It's kind of cool...

935
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:29,032
I guess.

936
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:30,950
Yeah.

937
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,163
Leaf.

938
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,041
Where you goin', hon?

939
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,502
Well, let's see
if we can't find us

940
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,378
something cooler. Come on.

941
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,588
Come on, guys.

942
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,007
Okay, babe. Lifelong dream.

943
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,717
All right. Go, go, go, go, go!

944
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,886
I smell alien.

945
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:58,186
He's deteriorating
without his host.

946
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,188
Poor thing.

947
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,191
Put him below with the others.

948
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,609
Safer there.

949
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,814
Down, down. Come on, come on.

950
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,200
All right.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

951
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,830
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

952
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,333
Follow me, guys. Come on.

953
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,377
This is so exciting.

954
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,087
I can't believe we're here.

955
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:27,400
Wow. Oh, wow.

956
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,570
What is this?

957
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,374
It's all broken.

958
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:46,169
So sad.

959
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,099
Buddy?

960
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:02,644
Hey, buddy?

961
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,357
Oh, no.

962
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:10,401
No.

963
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:17,075
Oh, my God, how many hangovers
can you have in one day?

964
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,869
<i>Eddie?</i>

965
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,167
Hello?

966
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,129
<i>They did this to me.</i>

967
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,008
<i>Mulligan?</i>

968
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,177
<i>Why?</i>

969
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,387
You're alive?

970
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,431
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

971
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,394
<i>We're being hunted, Eddie.</i>

972
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,563
You have what he needs.

973
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,986
Protect the codex
from dark hands.

974
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,448
A symbiote army waits here.

975
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:59,075
Free them.

976
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,536
Protect it, Eddie.

977
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:03,538
Knull...

978
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:08,084
must stay locked away.

979
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,257
Eddie, I'm Dr. Paine.

980
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:17,969
<i>Where's my friend?</i>

981
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,178
<i>He's safe for now.</i>

982
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:21,848
Great news!

983
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:24,100
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>
- We're all done here.

984
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,269
All of this
is out of your hands.

985
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:27,562
This is my lab.

986
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,897
No, no, not yours.
You just work here.

987
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,107
Or you did.

988
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,900
You, Christmas,
you're going home.

989
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,944
And what about them?

990
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:36,171
- You heard what it said.
<i>- Hands up.</i>

991
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,947
The codex only exists
if they're both alive.

992
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,407
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

993
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,160
You killed one of my people.

994
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,054
I'm returning the favor
personally. Please escort

995
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,139
- Dr. Paine out of here.
- No.

996
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,164
<i>- Don't move.</i>
- Christmas!

997
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,290
Time to go.

998
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,499
Hey!

999
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,302
Big mistake.

1000
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,894
- Fire!
- Run!

1001
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,858
- Oh, my God!
- Fall back, fall back!

1002
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:15,735
Go!

1003
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,992
Venom, run. Go!

1004
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:33,878
Let's go! Move! Clear! Clear!

1005
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,382
Release the symbiotes!

1006
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:38,549
Go! Go!

1007
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,684
- Come on.
- Go! Go!

1008
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,281
Hurry up! Move!

1009
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,033
Get back!

1010
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,661
Jim!

1011
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:21,801
Let's go.

1012
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,052
Take her down.

1013
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,837
Come on!

1014
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,970
Get the codex out of here.

1015
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,187
That's our way out.

1016
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,200
You, break us out of here!

1017
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,414
There's no aliens here, kids.

1018
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,004
<i>Best shoes ever!</i>

1019
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,256
Whoa! What was that?

1020
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,763
- Okay.
- We gotta go! Move it!

1021
01:11:57,355 --> 01:11:58,356
We are leaving!

1022
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,024
Move!

1023
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,359
Move, move!

1024
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:05,905
- Dad.
- It's all right, kids.

1025
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:14,497
Aliens! Alien invasion!

1026
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,332
Alien attack!

1027
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,093
Motherfucker!

1028
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,183
- You two, get airborne!
- Right away, sir!

1029
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,351
On me!

1030
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,980
Hurry up, airborne! Move, move,
move! In the Hummers! Go!

1031
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,440
<i>We've got to get the codex
as faraway as possible.</i>

1032
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,987
- It's Eddie?
- It's Eddie.

1033
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,197
- Eddie! Hey!
- Eddie!

1034
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,740
- Oh, no.
- Eddie, Eddie!

1035
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,954
Martin. And family.

1036
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,002
You can't be here, Martin.

1037
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,878
Dark forces, man.

1038
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,481
Eddie, can you help us?

1039
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,651
I lied. Aliens are real.

1040
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,903
My best friend
in the whole world is one.

1041
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,339
He's gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1042
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,948
Okay.

1043
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:35,953
- Don't... Don't be scared.
- Hi.

1044
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:37,038
Wow.

1045
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,040
Pleasure to meet you.

1046
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,959
Thanks for the chocolate.

1047
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:43,753
You're welcome.

1048
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:00,603
No!

1049
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,149
Mom, Dad!

1050
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:14,700
Dad!

1051
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,285
Hold on, kids!

1052
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:20,956
Hold on, kids!

1053
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,628
Eddie!

1054
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,934
He was trying to protect you.

1055
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,812
We are not the bad guys!

1056
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:47,775
Echo! Leaf.

1057
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,110
- My baby, my baby.
- Mom!

1058
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,861
- Thank you, Eddie.
- You're welcome.

1059
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,742
You gotta be kidding me.

1060
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:07,628
Get in!

1061
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:08,963
Run. Run.

1062
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,381
Run!

1063
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,384
Eddie!

1064
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,734
Go. Bring me that codex.

1065
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,448
What's that noise?

1066
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,700
<i>She phoned home.</i>

1067
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:43,998
Oh, shit.

1068
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:09,023
- Jesus!
- Get down! Get down! Get under!

1069
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:11,484
Take cover! Take cover!
I got you.

1070
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,954
<i>She saved us.</i>

1071
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,374
There's only one thing
that's gonna distract them.

1072
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,584
<i>Copy.</i>

1073
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:33,672
- Get 'em back to their van!
- What?

1074
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:35,633
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

1075
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,221
I'm gonna round them up.
Have the chopper follow me.

1076
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,517
Go, go, go! Go!

1077
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,448
Go!

1078
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,118
He's leading them to a kill box.

1079
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,162
When you get a lock,
vaporize 'em!

1080
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:32,231
We're home. We're back.
Okay, okay. Hold it.

1081
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,441
- Run!
- Go, kids! Go! Come on!

1082
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,568
Hurry. Hurry, honey.

1083
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:38,112
Thank you!

1084
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,240
Aliens suck!

1085
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,515
- Light 'em up!
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1086
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,195
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

1087
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,284
No! No!

1088
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:26,744
Thompson down!

1089
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,746
It's coming down. Go!

1090
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,555
Slide!

1091
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,853
Oh, sh...!

1092
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:54,813
Go away!

1093
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:04,990
Let's finish this.

1094
01:19:05,115 --> 01:19:06,784
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1095
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,625
The chopper blades!

1096
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,065
I got you.

1097
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:45,739
- It's okay.
- Get him somewhere safe.

1098
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,243
Oh, God.

1099
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:16,437
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

1100
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:18,647
Okay. Okay.

1101
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,752
No.

1102
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:43,714
Okay. Okay.

1103
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,887
Still living
your brother's dream?

1104
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,353
Oh, my God.

1105
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,819
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Dad, come on!

1106
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:08,155
Dad! Dad! Run! Come on!

1107
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,434
I'm proud of you, Eddie.

1108
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,269
You did it all yourself.

1109
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,356
Well, some of it.

1110
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:01,416
I really would have liked
to have seen her.

1111
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:07,840
Who?

1112
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,008
Lady Liberty.

1113
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:12,386
Oh, yeah.

1114
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,890
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well, we're going.

1115
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,185
We're gonna go just as soon
as we get...

1116
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:22,604
out of here.

1117
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,859
They're just going
to keep coming.

1118
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,111
We'll never leave
this place, friend.

1119
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,374
Okay, well...

1120
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,880
I thought we were gonna be
the Lethal Protector.

1121
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,302
We are.

1122
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:55,888
That's what this is.

1123
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,274
Yeah.

1124
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:33,967
All right.

1125
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,640
All right.

1126
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,152
Come and get us.

1127
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:57,467
Go.

1128
01:24:58,468 --> 01:24:59,886
Go.

1129
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:00,971
Go.

1130
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:08,437
Oh, my God.

1131
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:20,824
What are you doin'?

1132
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,038
I'll never forget you.

1133
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:32,878
Don't forget me either, Eddie.

1134
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,171
No.

1135
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:35,672
Time to go.

1136
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,386
- Strickland.
<i>- Strickland authorized.</i>

No.

1141

No!

1142
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,458
No! No!

1143
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:29,578
Go!

1144
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,107
No, Eddie!

1145
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:01,943
Eddie!

1146
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,028
Oh, my God.

1147
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,204
Nierika.

1148
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,355
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

1149
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,150
I just had a crazy dream.

1150
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:32,617
Buddy?

1151
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,327
He's not coming back.

1152
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,212
But I need him back.

1153
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,215
He wasn't meant for this place.

1154
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:49,009
You couldn't have kept him...

1155
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,469
and he couldn't have kept you.

1156
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:54,973
For your bravery,

1157
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:58,310
you both have the heartfelt
thanks of a grateful nation.

1158
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,772
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

1159
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,734
Everything that happened
in San Francisco

1160
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,402
and in the last few days...

1161
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:09,779
consider it expunged.

1162
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:18,872
Just so you're clear,
of course...

1163
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:21,750
you ever breathe a word of this
to any living soul

1164
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,502
you will spend
the rest of <i>that</i> life

1165
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:27,505
in the coldest,
darkest hole imaginable.

1166
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:31,259
Good luck, Eddie.

1167
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,189
I won't forget you, buddy.

1168
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:44,679
Your champion has fallen.

1169
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:48,808
The planets will be mine.

1170
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:52,937
The King in Black is awake.

1171
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,982
I will kill your world.

1172
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:59,193
Everyone will burn.

1173
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:00,612
And you...

1174
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,072
will watch.

1175
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,410
Hello? Hello?

1176
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:26,667
<i>¿Hola?</i> Hello?
