1
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,244
This is Berk.

2
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:41,558
So far off the map that
it might as well not exist.

3
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:44,285
My village?

4
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:46,632
In a word, sturdy.

5
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,151
It’s been here for generations,

6
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,878
but every single building
is new.

7
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:52,604
The air is crisp,
the water is clean,

8
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:55,365
and the views are nothing
to complain about.

9
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:58,403
The only downsides
are the pests.

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,310
You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.

11
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:10,622
We have...

12
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:18,561
Dragons.

13
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,670
Most people would leave.

14
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:26,224
Not us.

15
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:27,984
We’re Vikings.

16
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,917
We don’t run from fights.
We start them.

17
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:31,677
- Hey! Hiccup!
- Evening.

18
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:32,851
Go home!

19
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:34,301
I will just as soon as I, uh...

20
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,751
You’re in the way again!

21
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,101
Hiccup, play dead!

22
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,757
You see, dragons have been

23
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,276
a bit of a problem.

24
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:46,830
Here and, well, everywhere.

25
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:50,144
So we decided to take
the fight to them.

26
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,836
How’s that working out for us?

27
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:54,631
Eh...

28
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,327
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

29
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:02,984
What is he doing out again?

30
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,814
Get inside. Go on.

31
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:07,541
That’s Stoick the Vast,

32
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,818
chief of the tribe.

33
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,546
They say, when he was a baby,

34
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:14,996
he popped a dragon’s head
clean off its shoulders.

35
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,998
Do I believe it?

36
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,416
- Yes, I do.
- What have we got?

37
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:24,144
Gronckles, Nadders,
Zipplebacks, Skrills.

38
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:26,146
Snorti spotted
a Monstrous Nightmare.

39
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:27,388
Any Night Furies?

40
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:28,700
None so far, Chief.

41
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,598
Good.

42
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,359
- Follow me.
- HÜRL: Right, Chief.

43
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,395
Come on, you wretches!

44
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,535
HÜRL:
You heard him. Come on, lads.

45
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,333
Oh. Out again?

46
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,301
Just pretend I’m not even here.

47
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,199
I’ll be in and out
before you can say...

48
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:47,236
Not so fast.

49
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:48,651
Come on, please.

50
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,549
The meathead with attitude

51
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,551
and interchangeable hands
is Gobber.

52
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:53,966
Here. Go on.

53
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,934
I’ve been his apprentice

54
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:57,556
- ever since I was little.
- I’m keeping my eye on you.

55
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,040
I’m not even supposed
to be out here.

56
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,595
Ha! Since when did that
ever stop you?

57
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:05,875
Guard the food stores.

58
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:07,877
- Aye, Chief.
- Protect the livestock.

59
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:09,223
HÜRL:
Aye, Stoick.

60
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:11,121
And keep an ear out
for Night Furies.

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,891
Hammer.

62
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:30,555
Fire brigade!

63
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,246
Ah, the fire brigade.

64
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:34,144
Berk’s cool kids.

65
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:37,286
They get to be out
in the action.

66
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:39,391
Guys, out of the way!

67
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,600
But they’re nothing

68
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,084
without their captain,

69
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,949
the shining star
of our generation.

70
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,987
A-Amazing without even trying.

71
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,507
The one that smokes them all.

72
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,096
Astrid.

73
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,904
What?

74
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,699
Uh...

75
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:14,254
Shouldn’t you be in bed?

76
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,016
Come on, back to work.

77
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,777
You know,
I need to get out there.

78
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,710
Show my stuff, make my mark.

79
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:25,299
You’ve made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

80
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:27,474
Give me two minutes.
I’ll-I’ll take down a dragon.

81
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:30,304
My life will get
infinitely better.

82
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,926
I might even get a girlfriend.

83
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,342
There’s a Zippleback
behind you!

84
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,826
Astrid?

85
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,448
But she’s a real Viking.

86
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,829
You can’t wield a hammer.

87
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,658
You can’t swing an axe.

88
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,488
You can’t even throw
one of these.

89
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:43,938
See, but this...
this will throw it for me.

90
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,147
- Oh, another one.
- It’s fully redesigned.

91
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,701
It-it’s...

92
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,289
- Whoa!
- Whew!

93
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:51,325
It’s, uh...

94
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,569
double-barreled.

95
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:55,881
You see, this right here...
this is what I’m talking about.

96
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,367
Okay, this is a mild cal...
mild calibration issue.

97
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,334
If you ever want
to get out there

98
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:03,337
and start fighting dragons,
you’ve got to stop all of...

99
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,994
all of this.

100
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,306
You just gestured to all of me.

101
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:08,963
Yeah. Stop being all of you.

102
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,689
Oh...

103
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,104
Oh, yeah.

104
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,521
You, sir, are playing
a dangerous game.

105
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,661
Keeping this contained?

106
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,352
There will be consequences.

107
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,769
Well, I will take my chances.

108
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,221
Sword-- sharpen. Now.

109
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,570
One day, I’ll get out there.

110
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,678
Because killing a dragon
is everything around here.

111
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,370
Gronckles are tough.

112
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:39,477
Taking one down
would at least get me noticed.

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,619
A Zippleback?

114
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,000
Exotic, exciting.

115
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,659
Two heads, twice the status.

116
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:52,282
Lopping off a Nadder’s head

117
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,008
would definitely show them
I belong.

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,533
Come on, lads!

119
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,259
They found the sheep.

120
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,986
Then let loose
with everything we’ve got.

121
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,543
And then there’s

122
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:13,442
the Monstrous Nightmare.

123
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,238
Reload!

124
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,757
Only the best Vikings
go after those.

125
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,282
But the ultimate prize

126
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,492
is the dragon
that no one has ever seen.

127
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,943
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!

128
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:33,807
Jump!

129
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,709
And we’ve got a Night Fury.

130
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:43,575
Never steals food,
never shows itself.

131
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,543
And never misses.

132
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,271
Time for old Gobber
to take over.

133
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:54,517
Stay put here.

134
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,312
Here. I’m serious.

135
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,418
No one has
ever killed a Night Fury.

136
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:00,420
Attack!

137
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,767
That’s why
I’m going to be the first.

138
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:07,185
- You again? Get back inside!
- I’ll make a point of it.

139
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:08,945
You’re going to get
yourself killed, Hiccup!

140
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,982
I know! Sorry.

141
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,920
Here, give me that.

142
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,374
Mind yourself!

143
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:27,101
This Nadder still has
some fire in it.

144
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,148
Come on.

145
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:41,530
Give me something to shoot at.
Give me something to shoot at.

146
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,465
Come on, show yourself.

147
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,617
I hit it.

148
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,520
I hit it!

149
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:09,040
Did anybody see that?

150
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,698
Except for you.

151
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,013
Oh, gods.

152
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,708
Spitelout,
do not let that escape.

153
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:23,606
Thanks a lot.

154
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,150
You’re all out.

155
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,911
Let’s see what else
you’re made of.

156
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,759
Aye, that’s what I thought.

157
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:17,591
Oh, and there’s one
more thing to know.

158
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:22,044
Look out!

159
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,228
Sorry, Dad.

160
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,612
Watch out!

161
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,970
Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.

162
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,973
Dad, this isn’t like
any other time.

163
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,526
I mean, I really hit one.

164
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:59,081
Aye, a dragon
no one’s ever seen.

165
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:01,152
Because it uses night
as its camouflage.

166
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,464
If you squint, you can see it
blotting out the stars.

167
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,467
- That’s how I shot it down.
- Stop!

168
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,780
Stop.

169
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,508
Every time you step outside,
disaster happens.

170
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:16,788
Can you not see
that I have bigger problems?

171
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,134
Winter is almost here,

172
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,654
and I have an entire village
to feed.

173
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,345
Between you and me,
the village could do

174
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,313
with a little less feeding.

175
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,729
This isn’t a joke, Hiccup!

176
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,698
Why can’t you follow
the simplest orders?

177
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,872
Because I can’t stop myself.

178
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,290
Okay? I see a dragon,
and I have to just... kill it.

179
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,499
You know, i-it’s...
it’s who I am.

180
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,676
You are many things, son,

181
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:45,610
but a dragon killer
is not one of them.

182
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:50,960
Get back to the house.

183
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,928
Make sure he stays there.

184
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:55,516
How much can
one person mess up?

185
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,036
Anyone else would have been
booted off the island by now.

186
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:01,039
I guess being son of the chief
has its privileges.

187
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:04,111
If not for the chief, though...

188
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:09,461
Anyway, my dad’s
super proud of me, so...

189
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:12,085
Dad, I was just talking...

190
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:13,707
Don’t talk to me in public.

191
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,986
You know, I really did hit one.

192
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:18,574
Of course you did, Hiccup.

193
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,886
He never listens.

194
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:21,232
Well, that runs in the family.

195
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,510
And-and when he does,

196
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:26,202
it’s always with
some disappointed scowl,

197
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,963
like somebody forgot
the meat in the stew.

198
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,619
I’ve seen that look.

199
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:34,141
Oi. You’re thinking
about this all wrong, eh?

200
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,419
It’s not so much
what you look like.

201
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,974
It’s what’s inside of you
he can’t stand.

202
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:42,253
Thank you for summing that up.

203
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:45,290
W-Wait. The point is...

204
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:48,362
stop trying so hard
to be something you’re not.

205
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,608
I just want to be
one of you guys.

206
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,065
I know you do.

207
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:31,681
No one said it would be easy!

208
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,133
But may I remind you,

209
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:40,104
we are all descendants
of the finest dragon fighters

210
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:43,555
from everywhere
Vikings have traveled,

211
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:46,110
who gathered here
because they knew

212
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:48,457
that we were within
spitting distance

213
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,425
of a key dragon’s nest.

214
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:54,187
If we can just take it,

215
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,672
we can wipe out the devils
for good.

216
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,192
Take it? We can’t even find it.

217
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,400
Exactly.

218
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:01,781
This nest is starting to sound

219
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,299
more and more
like a fairy tale.

220
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,818
We’re exhausted.

221
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,268
And what do we have
to show for it, eh?

222
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:07,614
Nothing!

223
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:08,822
We have purpose.

224
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,651
Oh, come on.

225
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,034
We are the warriors of Berk,

226
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:17,866
the roughest, toughest tribe
this side of the sun.

227
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,524
No?

228
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,388
Phlegma.

229
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:27,876
We watched you take down
a Zippleback singlehandedly.

230
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,361
I mean, sure, you lost your leg
in the process,

231
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:33,053
but you came out on top,
didn’t you?

232
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,537
- Well...
- Yes, you did.

233
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:38,162
Retcha, your people came
from the Far East.

234
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,648
Fungi, yours all the way
from-from the Silk Road.

235
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,650
Loogi, your people came

236
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:46,377
from the sunbaked coasts
of Bláland.

237
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:47,999
And look at us.

238
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:50,001
We’re still here.
We’re still fighting.

239
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:53,315
We’re still watching
each other’s backs.

240
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:56,180
So are we really gonna pack up
and go home

241
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:57,871
while these bloody beasts

242
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:01,737
are still a threat
to all of our lands?

243
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,256
Is that who we are?

244
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,120
- No.
- Is it?

245
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,638
- No.
- Is it?!

246
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:07,639
No!

247
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:08,917
Is it?!

248
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:10,677
No!

249
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:11,747
Is it?

250
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,232
Uh, no, Chief, I guess not.

251
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,372
That’s what I thought.

252
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:22,862
Elder Gothi, give us a sign.

253
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,692
Do we stand a chance
of finding the nest

254
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,590
before the ice sets in?

255
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,818
Then that’s all I need.

256
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:54,065
Back into the fog we go.

257
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:55,411
All right, everyone.

258
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,275
Prepare the ships!

259
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:58,311
Let’s go!

260
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:12,946
Do I take my bucket hand
for when they burn our ships

261
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:16,536
or my swimming hand
for when they sink them?

262
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,267
Not so fast, Gobber.

263
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,857
I don’t have time to train
this year’s recruits,

264
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,100
so you’ll do it.

265
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:30,791
Ah, the old rite of passage.

266
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,932
Hiccup’s just come of age,
hasn’t he?

267
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,037
I meant the others.

268
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,557
Yeah, so while I’m busy,
he’ll c-cover the stall.

269
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:40,353
Molten steel,
razor-sharp blades,

270
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,526
lots of time on his hands.

271
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:42,976
What could possibly go wrong?

272
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:44,667
Oh, what am I gonna do
with him, Gobber?

273
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:47,256
Stick him in training.

274
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:49,155
No. I’m serious.

275
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,673
Yeah, so am I.

276
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,917
The kid wants this
more than anything.

277
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:54,988
Believe it or not,

278
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,163
that young man actually
wants to make you proud.

279
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:59,717
But he’s got a mind of his own.

280
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:01,719
Gets that from his mother.

281
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,307
Look what happened to her.

282
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,791
Yeah, ’cause Valka was
the stubborn one.

283
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,724
- See, when I was a boy...
- Oh, here we go.

284
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:09,071
I-I followed orders.
Right? I worked hard.

285
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:12,212
Because I believed
in what a-a Viking could do.

286
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,352
Crush mountains,

287
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,148
level forests, tame seas.

288
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:21,187
I knew what I was
and what I had to become.

289
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,674
Hiccup is... he’s not that boy.

290
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:30,196
What chance does he have
of following in my footsteps?

291
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:31,714
Yeah.

292
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,652
You can’t stop him, Stoick.

293
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,758
You can only prepare him.

294
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,484
Because the truth is

295
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:44,658
we aren’t always gonna
be around to protect him.

296
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:47,592
He’s gonna get out there again.

297
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,457
He’s probably out there now.

298
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:25,423
How could I lose
an entire dragon?!

299
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,244
I did it.

300
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,523
I did it!

301
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:42,190
Oh, why couldn’t you
have been dead?

302
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,608
Now I have to kill you.

303
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:45,416
Hiccup.

304
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:49,248
Dad. Uh...

305
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:53,597
Look, I need
to talk to you, Dad.

306
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,153
I need to speak
with you, too, son.

307
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:01,846
I’ve decided I don’t want

308
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:02,951
- to fight dragons.
- I think it’s time

309
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:03,814
you learn to fight dragons.

310
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:04,780
What?

311
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,057
Well, you go first.

312
00:21:06,195 --> 00:21:07,473
No, no, no, no.
You-you go first.

313
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:09,958
You get your wish.

314
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:11,442
Dragon training.

315
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,237
Start in the morning.

316
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:16,620
Oh, man, I really
should’ve gone first.

317
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,518
You know,
’cause I-I was thinking,

318
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:21,314
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

319
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:23,040
but do we have enough
bread-making Vikings or...

320
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:24,524
You’ll need this.

321
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,148
Dad... I don’t want
to fight dragons.

322
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,633
Come on.

323
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,324
Yes, you do.

324
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:32,877
No, let me rephrase.

325
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:34,638
I can’t kill dragons.

326
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,260
But you will.

327
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:38,538
No, I’m very extra sure
that I won’t.

328
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:41,610
It’s time, Hiccup.

329
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,374
Uh... can you not hear me?

330
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:48,859
Can you not hear me?!

331
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:58,040
The Trial of Flame is
where Vikings are made.

332
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:03,460
Where heroes are forged,
where future chiefs are born.

333
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,222
I... I’m none of those things.

334
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,743
I’m not like you, Dad.

335
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,646
Listen.

336
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:23,756
When you carry this axe,

337
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:26,034
you carry all of us with you.

338
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,898
Which means you walk like us,

339
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:31,384
you talk like us,
you think like us.

340
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:35,284
No more of... this.

341
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:38,218
You just gestured to all of me.

342
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,806
Deal?

343
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,394
This conversation is feeling
very one-sided.

344
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:43,879
Deal?

345
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:47,193
Deal.

346
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,884
Good.

347
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:56,409
Train hard.

348
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:00,413
I’ll be back.

349
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,418
Probably.

350
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,769
And I’ll be here.

351
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:15,048
Maybe.

352
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:22,953
Welcome to the Trial of Flame.

353
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:39,418
The moment
we’ve all been waiting for.

354
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:41,972
I just got to pick a spot
for my statue.

355
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,974
It’s so much bigger
from down here.

356
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:46,597
Can you guys believe
we’re actually standing here?

357
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:49,911
This is where Chief Greybile
slew the Whispering Death.

358
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,153
Yeah, and it’s where
Chief Tuffnut

359
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,603
will slay everything else.

360
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:53,984
- Watch and learn.
- Man, I can’t wait

361
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:55,882
to get some
legendary war wounds!

362
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,644
Yeah, like a nasty gash
right across my face.

363
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:00,059
- Call me boring...
- Boring.

364
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,578
...but I’m just excited to see

365
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:03,959
some real live dragons
up close.

366
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:07,031
You know, I could do without
the permanent injuries and...

367
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:08,792
Oh, where’s the glory in that?

368
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,379
Yeah, it’s only fun
if you get a scar out of it.

369
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:12,830
I know, right?

370
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:14,763
Pain.

371
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,109
Love it.

372
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,042
Oh, great. Who let him in?

373
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,666
Mm, I guess Daddy pulled
some strings, huh?

374
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:22,495
Aren’t you two, like,
a little old to be here?

375
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,186
- Ouch.
- Wait, what did you say, whippersnapper?

376
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:25,464
What did you say?
Can you say it again?

377
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:28,190
Yeah, touchy subject.

378
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:30,020
They’ve flunked dragon training
a few times.

379
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:31,987
Um, it was four times, actually.

380
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,782
Yeah, and it’s called
being held back.

381
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,853
As in too valuable
to let go of.

382
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,373
Real sensitive, Hiccup.

383
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,892
Nice name, by the way.

384
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,652
Your name is Snotlout.

385
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,757
Exactly.

386
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,931
It’s a manly Viking name.

387
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:46,346
Translates from
the ancient texts as

388
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,003
"one who beateth the snot
out of a..."

389
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:49,557
Shut up.

390
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:51,041
Let’s get started.

391
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:52,905
Bloody kids.

392
00:24:53,802 --> 00:24:57,357
You are now the latest to join
this time-honored tradition.

393
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,532
Every toe biter
born into our tribe

394
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,707
must one day survive this arena

395
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:04,951
if they ever hope to do battle
alongside the rest of us.

396
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:08,023
It will be grueling.

397
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:13,891
And it will be
very, very dangerous.

398
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:19,241
But whoever does best will win
the title of Top Slayer.

399
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:23,038
And with it...

400
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:26,559
And with it, the honor
of killing their first dragon

401
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:29,148
in front of the entire village.

402
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,253
There is no greater glory.

403
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:33,773
What?

404
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:35,603
Hiccup already killed
a Night Fury,

405
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:38,019
so does that, like, what,
disqualify him or...

406
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:40,504
Oh, ignore him.

407
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:42,057
You’re skinny.

408
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:43,611
You’re weak.

409
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,820
That’ll make you
less of a target.

410
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,304
They’ll see you
as slim pickings.

411
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:48,754
Not worth the effort.

412
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:52,067
They’ll go
after the more, uh...

413
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:54,035
Viking-like teens instead.

414
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:58,418
Behind these doors are just
a few of the many species

415
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,765
you will learn to fight.

416
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:02,215
The Deadly Nadder.

417
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,976
Attack eight, armor 16.

418
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:05,115
The Hideous Zippleback.

419
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,357
Plus 11 stealth, times two.

420
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:07,945
The Monstrous Nightmare.

421
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,878
- Firepower 15.
- The Terrible Terror.

422
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:12,122
- Attack eight, venom 12!
- Will you stop that!

423
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,090
You big bag of wool.

424
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:20,268
And finally,
the gruesome Gronckle.

425
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:22,408
Jaw strength eight.

426
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,965
Uh, hey, big guy,
aren’t you gonna, like,

427
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:29,864
teach us something first?

428
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,936
I believe in learning
on the job.

429
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:38,562
Today is all about defense.

430
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,669
If you get blasted, you’re out.

431
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:43,429
Or, you know, dead.

432
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,086
So what’s the first thing
you’re gonna need?

433
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:46,846
- A shield!
- Shield, yes. Go.

434
00:26:46,984 --> 00:26:48,537
- Out of my way.
- That one’s mine!

435
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:51,610
Shield is your most important
piece of equipment.

436
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:56,097
If you have to choose between
a weapon and a shield...

437
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,340
Just put it down.

438
00:26:58,478 --> 00:26:59,997
Take the shield.

439
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:01,033
- Give it!
- Mine, mine, mine!

440
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,275
Find your own shield!

441
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:09,489
Ruffnut, Tuffnut, you’re out.

442
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:13,355
Shields are good
for another thing: noise.

443
00:27:13,493 --> 00:27:16,151
Make plenty of it
to throw off the dragon’s aim.

444
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,261
Remember, all dragons have
a limited number of blasts.

445
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,090
How many does a Gronckle have?

446
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,713
Ooh, ooh! Six!

447
00:27:25,851 --> 00:27:27,162
Six, yes.

448
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,681
That’s one for each of you.

449
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,579
Although, interesting tidbit,

450
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:33,410
rocks from different regions
vary in mineral comp...

451
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:38,518
What are you do...
What are you doing?

452
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,969
What are you doing?
Get in there!

453
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:43,903
Fishlegs, you’re out.

454
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,734
- Four shots left.
- Yeah.

455
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:48,736
We’re pretty much gonna be
the stars of this thing.

456
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:50,392
Almost like we were meant
to be together.

457
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,015
It’s an elimination game, genius.

458
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:54,086
There’s only one Top Slayer.

459
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,505
Snotlout, you’re done.

460
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:01,024
Three shots.

461
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:03,267
Looks like it’s just
you and me, huh?

462
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:05,269
Nope. Just me.

463
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:08,169
Hey! Eyes on me!

464
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:17,765
Yes. Well done, Astrid.

465
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:20,250
Two shots left.

466
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,769
Oh, come on.

467
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:25,427
Hiccup, you’re out.

468
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:26,705
- One shot left.
- Hey, watch it!

469
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,847
Hiccup!

470
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,299
End of lesson.

471
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:42,617
Back to bed,
you overgrown sausage.

472
00:28:49,348 --> 00:28:55,319
Remember, a dragon
will always, always...

473
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,909
...go for the kill.

474
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,029
So, why didn’t you?

475
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,475
Okay.

476
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,494
Huh.

477
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:33,339
Let’s review, shall we?

478
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,859
Where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?

479
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:37,481
I mistimed my somersault dive.

480
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,311
It was sloppy.
It threw off my reverse tumble.

481
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:41,416
- Uh, yeah. We noticed.
- Hey.

482
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:43,936
Back off my girl. All right?

483
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:45,593
- She’s trying her best.
- Yeah.

484
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:47,629
Don’t beat yourself up.
You’ll get it.

485
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,459
Just follow my lead next time.

486
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:51,461
Astrid’s right.

487
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,566
You’ve got to be tough
on yourselves.

488
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,052
All it takes is one weak link.

489
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,090
You made it, then?

490
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:03,818
You got to start
taking this seriously,

491
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,820
because we are living
in a battleground.

492
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,961
And in case
you haven’t noticed,
the other side is winning.

493
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,239
You’re gonna need
every advantage you can get.

494
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:13,932
So, if you haven’t done
your homework,

495
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,830
allow me to present to you...

496
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,561
...the Book of Dragons.

497
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:27,014
Everything we know
about every dragon we know of.

498
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:29,948
Each of your tribes
brought their wisdom

499
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:32,191
and experience to these pages.

500
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:35,470
It’s our most hallowed
possession.

501
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,959
No dragon raids tonight,
so study up.

502
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:43,892
You mean read?

503
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,929
I’ve read it
like a hundred times.

504
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:48,311
There’s a Scauldron that sprays
your face with boiling water.

505
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:51,141
And then there’s,
um, another...

506
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,074
Why would I read words

507
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:56,181
when I can just kill the stuff
the words tell me stuff about?

508
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,803
Right? I mean, like,
I’m the kind of guy

509
00:32:57,941 --> 00:32:59,770
that other guys
write word books about.

510
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:01,772
Nice.

511
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,602
- SNOTLOUT and TUFFNUT: Boys!
- Don’t worry, though.

512
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,156
I’m here for all of your
dragon-related inquiries, okay?

513
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:07,468
Theories, stats.

514
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,781
I’ve even made,
um, cards, um...

515
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:13,474
You can ask me anything.

516
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:14,509
- Stop following me.
- Here.

517
00:33:14,647 --> 00:33:15,579
How about now? Try me now.

518
00:33:15,717 --> 00:33:17,685
Absolutely not.

519
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:27,039
So...

520
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:30,422
sounds like a gruesome,
grisly, good time, huh?

521
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:32,458
Read it.

522
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,460
Y-You know, uh...

523
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:37,049
maybe they’re not as bad
as we think they are.

524
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,847
Are you actually insane,
or do you just act that way?

525
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:44,401
Is-is there...
is there a third option?

526
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:47,991
Wiping out dragons
is why we’re here.

527
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:50,787
It’s why the best
of our tribes came together.

528
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:54,032
Because yes, dragons are
as bad as we think.

529
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,930
Y-Yeah, I-I know.
I’m just saying,

530
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,759
maybe we’re part
of the problem.

531
00:33:57,897 --> 00:34:01,798
You know, moving in on
their lands, eating their food.

532
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:08,149
Wow.

533
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,255
You live in
a different world, don’t you?

534
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:11,773
What?

535
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:14,224
Just coast by,
taking it all for granted.

536
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:15,605
Well, I don’t think that...

537
00:34:15,743 --> 00:34:16,813
Never having to work
for anything,

538
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:18,159
never struggling
to get a foot up.

539
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:20,161
Well, guess what.

540
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:22,163
I come from nothing.

541
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:26,409
No chief for a dad,
no handouts, no excuses.

542
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:28,342
I’m not afraid of hard work.

543
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,998
I’m willing to do whatever
it takes to get the job done,

544
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:31,759
which, in this case,
means wiping out the dragons

545
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:33,588
for the good of everyone.

546
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,797
Yeah.

547
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:37,903
You know what else?

548
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,768
I’m-I’m afraid...
afraid to ask.

549
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,498
I’ve got my eye
on that big house of yours.

550
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:48,741
I’m gonna be chief one day.

551
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,813
I-I don’t doubt it.

552
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,265
Actually, I think
my dad would be thrilled.

553
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:57,509
Besides, you’re the kid
he always hoped for.

554
00:34:57,647 --> 00:35:00,028
Instead, he got...

555
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,685
all this.

556
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:05,827
Stay out of my way, Hiccup.

557
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,397
"Dragon classifications.

558
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:27,021
"Strike class. Fear class.
Mystery class.

559
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,405
"Thunderdrum.

560
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:33,579
"When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

561
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,616
"that can kill a man
at close range.

562
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,756
"Extremely dangerous.

563
00:35:37,894 --> 00:35:39,723
"Timberjack.

00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:41,725

"The unholy offspring

572
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:05,024
Never engage this dragon."

573
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:19,177
I can almost smell them.

574
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:31,706
Take us in to Helheim’s Gate.

575
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:33,743
Here we go again.

576
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:36,194
Hard to port!

577
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,198
Hard to port!

578
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:45,893
Set the oars! Furl the sails!

579
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:47,377
All together.

580
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:48,999
Come on.

581
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:50,829
Higher.

582
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,153
We’re not alone!

583
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,775
- Look up!
- Watch your heads!

584
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:58,172
Turn back!

585
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,348
They’re everywhere!

586
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:05,731
Hey, I just, uh...
I just happened to notice

587
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:08,803
that the book had nothing
on Night Furies.

588
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:11,772
Is there maybe, like,
like, another book?

589
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,256
Maybe, like,
a Night Fury pamph...

590
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,501
Focus, Hiccup.

591
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,641
You’re not even trying.

592
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,506
Today is about attack.

593
00:38:21,644 --> 00:38:24,060
Nadders are quick
and light on their feet.

594
00:38:24,198 --> 00:38:27,650
Your job is to be quicker
and lighter.

595
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:37,315
Sorry.

596
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:43,182
I’m really beginning to
question your teaching methods!

597
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,632
Look for its blind spot.

598
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,978
Every dragon has one.

599
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,672
Find it, hide in it,
then strike.

600
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:53,883
Do you ever bathe?

601
00:38:54,021 --> 00:38:57,162
If you don’t like it, go find
your own blind spot. Go!

602
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,509
Blind spot, yes.

603
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:01,269
Deaf spot, not so much.

604
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:04,894
I am hurt. I am very much hurt.

605
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:07,448
So, how does one sneak up
on a Night Fury?

606
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:10,106
No one has ever met one
and lived to tell the tale.

607
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:11,901
- Now, get in there!
- Yeah, I-I know.

608
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,109
I-I’m just saying, like,

609
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:15,422
- how would...
- Hiccup.

610
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,044
Down.

611
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,886
Whoa, save yourself!

612
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:33,129
I’ll take care of this.

613
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,443
Oh.

614
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:38,617
Not my fault, Astrid.

615
00:39:38,755 --> 00:39:41,448
I got distracted
by the light in your eyes.

616
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:13,928
Wait! Just let me...

617
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:31,981
Yes. Well done, Astrid.

618
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,327
Nothing like giving them

619
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,673
a taste of
their own medicine, eh?

620
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:37,504
Also, "Well done, Snotlout,

621
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:39,298
with the assist," right?
What a team!

622
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,853
Is anyone taking this
seriously?!

623
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:43,544
Take it seriously.

624
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:45,166
’Cause in case you forgot,
our parents’ war

625
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:46,927
is about to become ours!

626
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:53,934
Figure out
which side you’re on.

627
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,881
Hmm? Huh?

628
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:19,053
Huh. Toothless.

629
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:22,056
I could’ve sworn you had...

630
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:25,888
...teeth.

631
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:32,446
I don’t have any more.

632
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:55,573
Thanks?

633
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:06,100
Oh, come on.
You’re kidding, right?

634
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:21,633
Mmm.

635
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,774
Hmm?

636
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:06,375
And then
he turned and grabbed me arm,

637
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:08,411
and with one twist,

638
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:11,829
he took my hand clean off
and he swallowed it whole.

639
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:13,831
Yeah, he must have spread
the word around,

640
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:17,179
’cause within a month,
another one had taken my leg.

641
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:18,594
Probably a Skrill.

642
00:47:18,732 --> 00:47:21,424
Serrated teeth,
jaw strength 17.

643
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:23,841
I’ll avenge
your fallen limbs, big guy.

644
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:25,394
I’ll chop off
the hands and feet

645
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:27,914
- of every dragon that I see.
- Nah.

646
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,469
It’s the wings
and the tail you want.

647
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:34,437
If they can’t fly,
they can’t get away.

648
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:37,233
A downed dragon
is a dead dragon.

649
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:40,202
Anyone can get by
without the other bits.

650
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,893
I’m gonna lose all of my limbs.

651
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:44,827
I volunteer Ruffnut
to lose at least one limb.

652
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:45,897
Huh?

653
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:47,416
What?

654
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:48,589
We’re twins.
Your pain is my pain.

655
00:47:48,727 --> 00:47:50,212
You’re twins?

656
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,386
Even our own mother
can’t tell us apart.

657
00:47:52,524 --> 00:47:54,423
It’s uncanny.

658
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:55,700
There we go.

659
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:57,736
Astrid’s got the right idea.

660
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,946
Get your sleep while you can.

661
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:02,465
Soon, Stoick will be back.

662
00:48:02,603 --> 00:48:05,365
And one of you will be chosen
to kill the dragon.

663
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:08,506
Question is: Who?

664
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:50,513
Toothless!

665
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,620
Brought breakfast.

666
00:49:00,282 --> 00:49:03,354
Huh? What do you think, bud?

667
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:04,976
Okay.

668
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:08,669
We got some cod...

669
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:11,086
...some salmon

670
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:13,019
and a whole smoked eel.

671
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:15,745
Whoa, uh, uh, uh...

672
00:49:15,883 --> 00:49:17,851
No eel! Scratch the eel!

673
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:23,339
Yeah, I, uh,
can’t say I love it, either.

674
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:29,794
That’s it.

675
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:31,899
Stick to the good stuff.

676
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:36,387
I’ll just be back here,

677
00:49:36,525 --> 00:49:38,976
minding my own business.

678
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:43,428
Okay.

679
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:05,071
Okay. Okay.

680
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,422
Whew. Okay. Not bad.

681
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,664
It could work.

682
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,390
If it’s... Whoa! Okay!

683
00:50:14,528 --> 00:50:17,014
Toothless, no! Oh, gods!

684
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,018
Toothless!

685
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:21,984
Oh, gods!

686
00:50:32,857 --> 00:50:34,962
It’s working!

687
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:37,758
Yeah! Whoo!

688
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:47,389
Yeah! Whoo!

689
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:49,736
Today is all about teamwork.

690
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:54,085
If you work together,
you might just survive.

691
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:59,401
You see, a wet dragon head
cannot light its fire.

692
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:02,093
But a Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky,

693
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:05,269
’cause one head breathes gas
and the other head lights it.

694
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:08,893
Your job is to know
which is which.

695
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:10,136
Good luck.

696
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:17,729
Razor-sharp fangs that inject
venom for predigestion.

697
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:20,629
- Prefers to keep its victims...
- Shh!

698
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:22,251
...conscious.

699
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:25,082
You know, I’m kind of glad
we got partnered.

700
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:28,637
Us girls got to stick together.

701
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:30,673
- Until I have to take you out.
- Shush.

702
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:32,710
I think I’ve
pretty much won Astrid over.

703
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:34,367
I mean, she can barely even
look at me.

704
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:37,232
You came
to the right man for advice.

705
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,992
- I didn’t ask...
- If there’s one thing

706
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,443
the Viking girl brain
can’t resist, it’s...

707
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:42,961
Look out!

708
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:47,138
- Hey!
- It’s us, geniuses.

709
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:48,346
Lightning reflexes.

710
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:49,899
I see hideous heads, I strike.

711
00:51:50,037 --> 00:51:51,798
Ow.

712
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:53,248
Whoa.

713
00:51:53,386 --> 00:51:55,008
Uh, make that
one hideous head, Astrid.

714
00:51:59,323 --> 00:52:01,428
Save yourselves!

715
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:04,328
Also known
to toy with its victims,

716
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:06,123
dismembering them
limb from limb.

717
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:08,711
Will you please stop that?

718
00:52:10,817 --> 00:52:12,059
Fishlegs!

719
00:52:14,786 --> 00:52:16,340
Wrong head.

720
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:21,483
Get out of there, Hiccup!

721
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:24,658
Oh, come on.

722
00:52:34,806 --> 00:52:37,015
Yeah. Back!

723
00:52:38,396 --> 00:52:41,088
Run... Hiccup.

724
00:52:41,227 --> 00:52:43,436
Don’t make me
tell you again! Yeah.

725
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:45,886
Yeah, that’s right.
Back in your pen.

726
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,409
Now, think about
what you’ve done.

727
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,534
So, are we done today?

728
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:15,744
J-Just because I have
some things I need to, uh...

729
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,161
Yeah, I’m gonna... I’m gonna
see you guys tomorrow.

730
00:53:26,893 --> 00:53:27,756
Huh?

731
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:30,759
Hey.

732
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:32,243
Oh, come on.

733
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:33,693
Just try it.

734
00:53:43,772 --> 00:53:45,601
Whoa!

735
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:47,431
Oh, I’m gonna die!

736
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:50,434
Whoa, whoa, no!

737
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:53,299
No, please!

738
00:53:53,437 --> 00:53:56,474
Just kind of angle yourself.

739
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:58,683
Whoa!

740
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:04,241
Whoa, whoa, no!

741
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,314
Oh, come on!

742
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,434
- Out of my way.
- Move!

743
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:27,022
Move, move, move,
move, move, move!

744
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,989
Watch yourselves.
Get in its blind spot.

745
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:30,508
I got it! It’s mine!

746
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:32,130
No, don’t bring it over here!

747
00:54:44,936 --> 00:54:46,973
Uh, little guy.
What is his name again?

748
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:49,251
- I don’t remember.
- Hey. Slow down.

749
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:51,184
- Are you trying to show us up?
- N-No.

750
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:52,944
I’ve never seen someone
take down a Gronckle like that.

751
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,774
I mean, I do it all the time,
but how did you learn?

752
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:56,983
Learn what?
What exactly was that?

753
00:54:57,121 --> 00:54:59,123
Okay, see,
I-I’d love to explain.

754
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:01,712
It’s just, I left my axe
back in-in the ring.

755
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,507
Who’s a good boy?
Who’s a good boy?

756
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,474
Whoa, okay.

757
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:07,752
Yeah, yeah? You itchy?

758
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,340
Is that the spot?

759
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:45,652
Hiccup.

760
00:55:49,035 --> 00:55:50,657
Yo, there he is.

761
00:55:50,795 --> 00:55:52,659
Hey, Hiccup.

762
00:55:52,797 --> 00:55:54,385
- Okay.
- Hiccup. W-W-Wait.

763
00:55:54,523 --> 00:55:56,249
- I have a proper question.
- So I’m thinking that...

764
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,527
All it needs to be
is you and me in the ring.

765
00:56:07,225 --> 00:56:09,089
A Terrible Terror!

766
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:18,409
It’s like the size of my...

767
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:20,894
Get it off!

768
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:22,724
Get it off! Get it off!

769
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:51,640
Ow.

770
00:58:06,413 --> 00:58:08,277
And the other ships?

771
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:21,912
Dad!

772
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,016
I got it.

773
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,605
I missed you.

774
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:27,676
In, like, a super manly way.

775
00:58:27,814 --> 00:58:30,161
I got so much to tell you
about the Trial of Flame.

776
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,612
It’s basically between... Dad?

777
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,235
Dad?

778
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:37,479
Da...

779
00:58:37,617 --> 00:58:39,377
Okay, I’ll see you at home.

780
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,725
So, no nest, then?

781
00:58:41,863 --> 00:58:44,279
Not even close.

782
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:46,350
I hope you had more success.

783
00:58:46,488 --> 00:58:47,903
Well, if by success,

784
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,629
you mean your parenting
troubles are over,

785
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:51,942
then, uh, yeah.

786
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,117
Did you hear the news, Chief?

787
00:58:55,255 --> 00:58:57,948
- Everyone is so relieved.
- Good riddance to old Hiccup.

788
00:58:58,086 --> 00:58:59,536
Aye.

789
00:58:59,674 --> 00:59:01,641
No one will miss that nuisance.

790
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,266
Hiccup is...

791
00:59:06,404 --> 00:59:07,509
gone?

792
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,097
Yeah.

793
00:59:09,235 --> 00:59:11,375
Yeah, most afternoons,
but who can blame him?

794
00:59:11,513 --> 00:59:13,342
The life of a celebrity
can be very rough.

795
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,930
He can barely walk
through the village

796
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:17,830
without being swarmed
by his army of new fans.

797
00:59:19,452 --> 00:59:21,903
Who would’ve thought
he has this...

798
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,630
way with the beasts?

799
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,953
All right, bud.

800
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:40,542
We’re gonna take this
nice and slow.

801
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:43,718
Here we go.

802
00:59:43,856 --> 00:59:44,926
Position three.

803
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:46,790
Uh, no, four.

804
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,255
You ready?

805
01:00:18,753 --> 01:00:20,617
Come on. Come on.

806
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,531
Yeah, look at us!

807
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:40,982
Whoa!

808
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,295
My fault. My fault.

809
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,263
Yeah, yeah, I’m on it.

810
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:47,713
Position five.

811
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:52,338
Come on, bud.

812
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah. Go, baby!

813
01:00:59,138 --> 01:01:01,002
Oh, this is amazing!

814
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,969
The wind in my...

815
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:05,627
Cheat sheet! Stop!

816
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:12,565
Oh, gods!

817
01:02:20,909 --> 01:02:21,979
Yeah!

818
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:34,992
Son!

819
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:36,683
Dad! Uh, you’re back.

820
01:02:36,822 --> 01:02:38,927
Uh, uh, oh...
Okay, uh, Gobber’s not here,

821
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:41,067
- so, um...
- I know.

822
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:44,968
Came looking for you.

823
01:02:45,106 --> 01:02:47,487
You-you-you did? Uh, wh-why?

824
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:49,489
You’ve been keeping secrets.

825
01:02:49,627 --> 01:02:51,319
I have?

826
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:54,287
Just how long did you think
you could hide it from me?

827
01:02:55,047 --> 01:02:56,807
I-I don’t even know
what you’re talking...

828
01:02:56,945 --> 01:03:02,640
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

829
01:03:03,918 --> 01:03:09,233
So, let’s talk
about that dragon.

830
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:10,787
Oh, gods, Dad.

831
01:03:10,925 --> 01:03:12,685
I’m-I’m-I’m so sorry.

832
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:14,204
I-I was gonna tell you sooner.

833
01:03:14,342 --> 01:03:15,964
I just didn’t know...

834
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:23,730
You’re not upset?

835
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:25,905
What? What?

836
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:28,045
I was hoping for this.

837
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:29,875
- You were?
- Oh, yes.

838
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:33,050
And believe me,
it only gets better.

839
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:35,225
Just wait till you spill

840
01:03:35,363 --> 01:03:37,365
a Nadder’s guts
for the first time.

841
01:03:37,503 --> 01:03:42,473
Or-or mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear.

842
01:03:42,611 --> 01:03:44,510
What a feeling.

843
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:46,823
You really had me
going there, son.

844
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:50,654
All those years
of the worst Viking

845
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:53,036
Berk has ever seen.

846
01:03:53,174 --> 01:03:55,038
Odin, it was rough.

847
01:03:55,176 --> 01:03:56,694
I almost gave up on you.

848
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,836
And all the while,
you were holding out on me.

849
01:04:01,147 --> 01:04:03,184
Thor almighty.

850
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:05,462
Who would have thought
that dragon training

851
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,568
would have been
your place to shine, huh?

852
01:04:08,706 --> 01:04:11,640
Ah, you might even win
Top Slayer.

853
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:13,159
Just like your old man.

854
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:15,161
Who knows?

855
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:16,783
You know...

856
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:18,889
with you doing so well
in the ring...

857
01:04:19,027 --> 01:04:20,649
I’m gonna... I’m gonna...

858
01:04:20,787 --> 01:04:22,065
- Sit.
- Okay.

859
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:25,206
We finally have something
to talk about.

860
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:34,387
So, I...

861
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,297
Oh! Oh, I, uh...

862
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:49,886
I brought you something...

863
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:52,371
to... to, uh...

864
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:55,684
keep you safe in the ring.

865
01:04:57,963 --> 01:05:00,897
Your mother would have
wanted you to have it.

866
01:05:01,725 --> 01:05:03,761
W-Wow. Uh, thanks.

867
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,660
It’s half of her breastplate.

868
01:05:07,075 --> 01:05:09,112
Matching set.

869
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,528
Keeps her...

870
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,806
It keeps her close, you know?

871
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:17,327
Wear it proudly, son.

872
01:05:17,465 --> 01:05:20,537
You’ve held up
your end of the deal.

873
01:05:25,266 --> 01:05:26,681
Yeah.

874
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:29,063
- Yeah. Tired.
- Yeah, I’m gonna...

875
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:31,099
- I’m gonna get some s-sleep.
- Uh, good talk.

876
01:05:31,237 --> 01:05:32,825
- Big day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

877
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:34,275
The Trial of Flame,
and it takes a lot out of you.

878
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:36,001
Yeah, Trial of Flames--
Flame.

879
01:05:36,139 --> 01:05:37,830
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah, thank you, thank you

880
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:38,935
- for the, uh... the breast hat.
- I hope you like the...

881
01:05:39,073 --> 01:05:41,627
- Hat. Yeah.
- Yeah.

882
01:05:41,765 --> 01:05:44,733
Okay, well...
good night.

883
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:55,261
No more of your tricks.

884
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:57,194
- I’m taking Top Slayer today.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

885
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,956
It’s-it’s all yours.
Top-Top Slay away.

886
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:01,302
Sorry.

887
01:06:23,324 --> 01:06:26,016
Last chance. Make it count.

888
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:33,713
Come on!

889
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:35,577
- Go on, Astrid! You got it!
- Come on, Hiccup!

890
01:06:35,715 --> 01:06:38,201
- Go on!
- Come on!

891
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:43,413
No!

892
01:06:43,551 --> 01:06:46,036
Son of a half-troll,
rat-eating...

893
01:06:46,174 --> 01:06:47,900
Glad to see
she’s handling it gracefully.

894
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:49,453
You!

895
01:06:53,492 --> 01:06:55,735
Uh, okay.

896
01:06:55,873 --> 01:06:57,254
- Later.
- Hey, hey. Not so fast.

897
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,773
- Quiet down.
- No, I can’t.

898
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:00,050
- I’m gonna be late for, uh...
- What?

899
01:07:00,188 --> 01:07:01,603
Late for what, exactly?

900
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:03,053
- Another year...
- Shut up.

901
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:04,468
...and another Trial of Flame

902
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:06,091
has come to an end.

903
01:07:06,229 --> 01:07:09,680
Elder Gothi has made
her decision.

904
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:16,549
The new Top Slayer will be...

905
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:40,090
You’ve done it, Hiccup.

906
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:41,885
You won the Trial of Flame.

907
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:43,404
You get to kill the dragon.

908
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,268
That’s my boy!

909
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:52,206
Hiccup, you won!

910
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:56,693
Whoa! Yeah.

911
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:58,246
Hooray me.

912
01:07:58,384 --> 01:07:59,972
I can’t wait to...

913
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,319
Beat it and never come back.

914
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:04,183
All right, bud. Time’s up.

915
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:06,116
My thoughts exactly.

916
01:08:06,254 --> 01:08:08,153
Wh-What are you, uh...

917
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:10,120
What are you doing here?

918
01:08:10,258 --> 01:08:12,018
- Looking for answers.
- Huh?

919
01:08:12,157 --> 01:08:13,503
What are you doing here?

920
01:08:13,641 --> 01:08:15,194
Who’s Bud? Your trainer?

921
01:08:15,332 --> 01:08:16,609
Did he dress you up in this?

922
01:08:16,747 --> 01:08:18,439
Uh, I-I know
this looks suspicious,

923
01:08:18,577 --> 01:08:20,751
but f-funnily enough, I, uh...

924
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:23,168
Uh, you’re right!
You’re right. I, uh...

925
01:08:23,306 --> 01:08:24,824
I’m through with the lies.

926
01:08:24,962 --> 01:08:27,241
I’ve been making outfits,
so, um, you got me.

927
01:08:27,379 --> 01:08:28,311
It’s time everybody knew.

928
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:29,795
Just take me back.

929
01:08:29,933 --> 01:08:31,417
Ow!

930
01:08:31,555 --> 01:08:32,625
Why would you do that?

931
01:08:32,763 --> 01:08:34,075
That’s for the lies.

932
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:37,906
And that’s for everything else.

933
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:41,324
Oh, no.

934
01:08:41,462 --> 01:08:43,360
Run. Run!

935
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:44,810
No! No.

936
01:08:44,948 --> 01:08:46,639
- What...
- Toothless, no!

937
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:47,951
Stop. It’s okay.

938
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:50,643
She’s a friend. She’s a friend.

939
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:58,030
Toothless, Astrid.
Astrid, Toothless.

940
01:08:58,168 --> 01:09:01,275
The, uh... the Night Fury.

941
01:09:06,763 --> 01:09:08,799
I wouldn’t.

942
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:14,805
We’re dead.

943
01:09:16,704 --> 01:09:19,396
Hey. Where do you think
you’re going?

944
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:52,567
Hiccup! Get me down from here!

945
01:09:52,705 --> 01:09:54,569
You have to give me
a chance to explain.

946
01:09:54,707 --> 01:09:57,020
I’m not listening to anything
you have to say.

947
01:09:57,158 --> 01:09:58,849
Then I won’t speak.

948
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,886
Just let us show you.

949
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:03,095
Please, Astrid.

950
01:10:14,555 --> 01:10:15,797
What is this?

951
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:18,248
Uh, it’s my design.

952
01:10:19,076 --> 01:10:21,217
Yeah.
Pretty much the cocaptain.

953
01:10:23,426 --> 01:10:25,842
Then let’s get this over with.

954
01:10:26,774 --> 01:10:27,913
You got it.

955
01:10:28,051 --> 01:10:31,227
Toothless, let’s take her down.

956
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,919
Gently.

957
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:36,542
Nothing to be afraid of.

958
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:44,826
Oh, nice touch!

959
01:10:48,451 --> 01:10:50,004
I thought you were
his cocaptain!

960
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:52,627
I am! It’s a temporary
dragon malfunction!

961
01:10:56,321 --> 01:10:58,288
We worked out a whole system, remember?

962
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:02,913
If we survive,
I’m gonna kill you!

963
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,781
And now the spinning.

964
01:11:08,919 --> 01:11:12,302
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

965
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,753
Please just make it stop.

966
01:11:16,582 --> 01:11:18,929
I’m clearly not
the one in control.

967
01:11:19,067 --> 01:11:20,345
Then I’m sorry!

968
01:11:20,483 --> 01:11:23,313
Toothless, I’m sorry!

969
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:07,037
Fine.

970
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,420
You made your point.

971
01:13:12,629 --> 01:13:15,839
It doesn’t change the fact
you have to kill one tomorrow.

972
01:13:17,531 --> 01:13:18,946
But if we can change
your mind...

973
01:13:19,084 --> 01:13:20,603
What?

974
01:13:20,741 --> 01:13:22,708
You gonna take everyone up
for a magical ride?

975
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:28,749
It won’t erase what they’ve
done to us, Hiccup.

976
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:31,407
They hunt us, steal our food.

977
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:33,236
And one of them took my mom.

978
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:34,962
But do we just keep
killing one another?

979
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,067
As opposed to...?

980
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,276
I-I don’t know.

981
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:44,281
But you botched
our escape plan,
so I’m gonna need a minute.

982
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:51,634
Well, I might
not snitch on you.

983
01:13:52,773 --> 01:13:55,016
And we might not
drop you in the sea.

984
01:13:59,193 --> 01:14:01,851
Bud? What’s up?

985
01:14:01,989 --> 01:14:03,300
What is it?

986
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,096
Hey. Hey.

987
01:14:07,235 --> 01:14:08,133
Get down!

988
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:13,863
Toothless, get us out of here.

989
01:14:18,902 --> 01:14:22,009
It looks like they’re
hauling in their kill.

990
01:14:22,147 --> 01:14:24,287
Then what does that make us?

991
01:15:00,081 --> 01:15:02,428
The dragons’ nest.

992
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,846
Oh, what my dad wouldn’t give
to find this.

993
01:15:39,811 --> 01:15:41,260
What is that?

994
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:45,886
All right, bud, time to go.

995
01:15:54,446 --> 01:15:57,483
I can’t believe it took
this long to figure it out.

996
01:15:57,622 --> 01:15:59,831
It all makes sense now.

997
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:02,316
It’s like a giant beehive.

998
01:16:02,454 --> 01:16:04,801
They’re the workers,
and that’s their queen.

999
01:16:04,939 --> 01:16:06,078
Their alpha.

1000
01:16:06,216 --> 01:16:07,735
It controls them.

1001
01:16:07,873 --> 01:16:09,288
We got to find your dad.

1002
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:10,911
No, no, no, not yet.

1003
01:16:11,049 --> 01:16:14,224
They’ll...
they’ll kill Toothless.

1004
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:19,954
Astrid, we have to think
this through carefully.

1005
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:25,753
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons’ nest,

1006
01:16:25,891 --> 01:16:27,997
and you want
to keep it a secret?

1007
01:16:28,135 --> 01:16:30,586
To protect your pet dragon?

1008
01:16:31,414 --> 01:16:33,485
Are you serious?

1009
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:35,936
Yes.

1010
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:46,878
Okay.

1011
01:16:48,086 --> 01:16:50,709
Then... what do we do?

1012
01:16:54,679 --> 01:16:56,473
Just give me until tomorrow.

1013
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,475
I’ll figure it out.

1014
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:02,445
That’s for kidnapping me.

1015
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:05,448
Hey, are you gonna...

1016
01:17:07,864 --> 01:17:11,143
And that’s for everything else.

1017
01:17:21,015 --> 01:17:23,673
What?

1018
01:17:34,097 --> 01:17:38,515
Well, I can finally show
my face in public again.

1019
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:44,349
All right.

1020
01:17:44,487 --> 01:17:48,249
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks,

1021
01:17:48,387 --> 01:17:53,151
Hiccup would’ve gone
from being, well, Hiccup...

1022
01:17:55,325 --> 01:17:58,535
...to placing first
in the Trial of Flame,

1023
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,399
I mean, I would’ve tied them
to a mast

1024
01:18:00,537 --> 01:18:03,471
and shipped them off
for fear they’d gone mad.

1025
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:06,198
And you know it.

1026
01:18:09,305 --> 01:18:11,272
But here we are.

1027
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:16,588
My son has won the title
of Top Slayer.

1028
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,350
No one is more surprised...

1029
01:18:23,077 --> 01:18:26,253
...or more proud than I am.

1030
01:18:28,013 --> 01:18:32,569
Today, my boy
becomes a warrior.

1031
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:37,436
Today, he becomes one of us!

1032
01:18:37,574 --> 01:18:40,439
Yeah!

1033
01:18:40,577 --> 01:18:42,269
Yeah!

1034
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,547
Yeah!

1035
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,894
Yeah!

1036
01:18:47,032 --> 01:18:49,552
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1037
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:52,279
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1038
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:55,903
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1039
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:59,010
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1040
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:01,667
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1041
01:19:01,806 --> 01:19:03,428
Hiccup! Hiccup!

1042
01:19:03,566 --> 01:19:06,051
Watch out for that dragon.

1043
01:19:07,604 --> 01:19:10,573
It’s not the dragon
I’m worried about.

1044
01:19:12,851 --> 01:19:15,267
Look, I’m gonna try
to put an end to all this,

1045
01:19:15,405 --> 01:19:19,133
but if something goes wrong
in there, just...

1046
01:19:19,271 --> 01:19:20,479
don’t get involved.

1047
01:19:20,617 --> 01:19:22,965
My dad respects you too much.

1048
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,972
Yeah.

1049
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:31,767
But...

1050
01:19:31,905 --> 01:19:34,079
you have something I don’t.

1051
01:19:34,977 --> 01:19:38,325
Something none of us have.

1052
01:19:39,636 --> 01:19:44,193
So... I’m going
to stand by you,

1053
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:45,988
come what may.

1054
01:19:49,129 --> 01:19:50,613
Come what may.

1055
01:19:52,477 --> 01:19:53,892
It’s time, Hiccup.

1056
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,622
Knock him dead, son.

1057
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:13,049
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1058
01:20:13,187 --> 01:20:16,881
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1059
01:20:17,019 --> 01:20:19,642
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1060
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:23,370
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1061
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:25,821
Hiccup! Hiccup!

1062
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:28,375
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1063
01:20:28,513 --> 01:20:29,825
Go, Hiccup!

1064
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,827
Show ’em everything
I taught you!

1065
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:33,207
Should’ve been me.

1066
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,417
Whew. All right?

1067
01:20:36,555 --> 01:20:38,385
Good crowd, isn’t it?

1068
01:20:38,523 --> 01:20:40,421
Hiccup! Hiccup!

1069
01:20:40,559 --> 01:20:44,287
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

1070
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,509
I would have gone
with the hammer.

1071
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:01,995
Just-just give him a chance.

1072
01:21:09,519 --> 01:21:11,004
I’m ready.

1073
01:22:17,277 --> 01:22:19,658
What is he doing?

1074
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,799
I’m not gonna hurt you.

1075
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,018
I’m not one of them.

1076
01:22:46,444 --> 01:22:48,653
- Stop the fight.
- No.

1077
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,827
You all need to see this.

1078
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,969
They’re not
what we think they are.

1079
01:22:55,315 --> 01:22:56,937
We don’t have to kill them.

1080
01:22:58,318 --> 01:23:00,837
I said stop the fight!

1081
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,260
Out of my way!

1082
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:11,676
Get out of there, Hiccup!

1083
01:23:13,333 --> 01:23:14,920
Hiccup!

1084
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:35,907
Quick, quick! Grab his hand!

1085
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:37,529
- Climb up.
- Hiccup, grab my hand!

1086
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:39,221
- Get up here!
- Hurry up!

1087
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:40,394
Get over here, man!
Just grab his hand!

1088
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:51,543
Astrid, get back here!

1089
01:23:51,681 --> 01:23:53,476
That’s an order!

1090
01:24:01,174 --> 01:24:02,347
Run!

1091
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:04,142
Come on.

1092
01:24:06,903 --> 01:24:08,284
Hiccup!

1093
01:24:18,915 --> 01:24:21,608
Night Fury.

1094
01:24:22,609 --> 01:24:25,543
- Night Fury!
- He’s real!

1095
01:24:52,915 --> 01:24:54,744
All right, bud. Go on. Go.

1096
01:24:57,471 --> 01:24:59,508
Go, go! Get to the side of him!

1097
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,444
Get out of the way, Hiccup!

1098
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:10,243
No, stop.
You’re only making it worse!

1099
01:25:12,452 --> 01:25:13,625
Astrid!

1100
01:25:17,491 --> 01:25:19,148
I got it. Go!

1101
01:25:20,977 --> 01:25:22,772
Stoick, he won’t hurt you.

1102
01:25:32,955 --> 01:25:34,784
No!

1103
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:40,790
Toothless!

1104
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:42,067
Don’t.

1105
01:25:45,692 --> 01:25:48,557
Take it down!

1106
01:25:49,351 --> 01:25:50,455
Grab its legs!

1107
01:25:50,593 --> 01:25:51,974
- Hold it down!
- No!

1108
01:25:52,112 --> 01:25:54,632
- No, don’t hurt him!
- Stay back!

1109
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,501
And you...

1110
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:17,068
Put it with the others.

1111
01:26:23,316 --> 01:26:24,593
- I should have known!
- Dad.

1112
01:26:24,731 --> 01:26:26,111
- I should have seen the signs.
- Dad!

1113
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,285
We had a deal!

1114
01:26:27,423 --> 01:26:29,011
I-I know,
but that was before...

1115
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:30,909
It’s all so messed up.

1116
01:26:31,047 --> 01:26:35,293
So everything in the ring,
what, a-a trick? A lie?

1117
01:26:35,431 --> 01:26:37,537
No, I-I should have told you
before now.

1118
01:26:37,675 --> 01:26:39,470
Take that out on me--
it’s my fault--

1119
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:41,782
but please
don’t hurt Toothless.

1120
01:26:42,852 --> 01:26:44,820
The dragon?

1121
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:47,236
That’s what you’re
worried about?

1122
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:49,307
Not the people
you almost killed?

1123
01:26:49,445 --> 01:26:51,551
He’s not dangerous.
He-he was protecting me.

1124
01:26:51,689 --> 01:26:55,348
They took your mother,
for gods’ sake!

1125
01:26:56,521 --> 01:26:59,869
If she could see you now
standing there with them

1126
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:01,906
when they’ve killed
hundreds of us.

1127
01:27:02,044 --> 01:27:03,563
And we’ve killed
thousands of them!

1128
01:27:03,701 --> 01:27:05,185
They defend themselves.

1129
01:27:05,323 --> 01:27:06,566
That’s all.

1130
01:27:06,704 --> 01:27:08,050
They raid us
because they have to.

1131
01:27:08,188 --> 01:27:09,465
If they don’t bring
enough food back,

1132
01:27:09,603 --> 01:27:10,984
they’ll be eaten themselves.

1133
01:27:11,122 --> 01:27:12,882
There’s something else
on their island.

1134
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:14,574
A dragon like I’ve never seen.

1135
01:27:14,712 --> 01:27:16,472
Their island?

1136
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,889
You’ve been to the nest.

1137
01:27:20,752 --> 01:27:22,271
Did I say nest?

1138
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:24,239
How did you find it?

1139
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:26,171
I didn’t. Toothless did.

1140
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,898
Only a dragon
can find the island.

1141
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,697
No. Dad, no.

1142
01:27:34,835 --> 01:27:36,181
You don’t know
what you’re up against.

1143
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,632
This is nothing like
you’ve ever seen.

1144
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:40,358
You can’t win this one.

1145
01:27:40,496 --> 01:27:42,153
For once in your life,
would you please

1146
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:43,775
just listen to me?

1147
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,955
You’ve thrown your lot
in with them.

1148
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:54,407
You’re not one of us.

1149
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,650
You’re not my son.

1150
01:28:05,832 --> 01:28:07,178
Ready the ships!

1151
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:09,801
We sail at dawn!

1152
01:28:38,485 --> 01:28:40,556
Forward on the leading line!

1153
01:28:40,694 --> 01:28:41,833
Swing it out slightly.

1154
01:28:41,971 --> 01:28:43,559
Here she comes. Easy.

1155
01:28:43,697 --> 01:28:45,630
Careful with the head.

1156
01:28:46,528 --> 01:28:48,219
Oh, careful now.

1157
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:50,221
Weapons loaded!

1158
01:28:50,359 --> 01:28:52,016
Spare rigging aboard?

1159
01:28:52,154 --> 01:28:54,225
- Aye.
- Hoist the sails!

1160
01:28:54,363 --> 01:28:55,951
Aye, Chief.

1161
01:28:58,609 --> 01:29:01,025
- Ready the oars.
- Aye, Stoick.

1162
01:29:02,164 --> 01:29:05,374
We set sail for Helheim’s Gate!

1163
01:29:22,426 --> 01:29:24,531
Lead us home, devil.

1164
01:29:55,148 --> 01:29:56,805
I tried to stop them.

1165
01:29:57,633 --> 01:30:00,187
I ended up giving them
exactly what they wanted.

1166
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:05,676
I should’ve just...

1167
01:30:05,814 --> 01:30:08,541
I should’ve killed him when
I found him in those woods.

1168
01:30:10,612 --> 01:30:12,786
It would have been better
for everyone.

1169
01:30:12,924 --> 01:30:14,236
Yeah.

1170
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:16,376
The rest of us
would have done it.

1171
01:30:19,137 --> 01:30:20,587
So, why didn’t you?

1172
01:30:21,381 --> 01:30:22,796
- Why didn’t you?
- I don’t know.

1173
01:30:22,934 --> 01:30:24,384
- I-I couldn’t.
- That’s not an answer.

1174
01:30:24,522 --> 01:30:26,110
Why is this so important to you
all of a sudden?

1175
01:30:26,248 --> 01:30:28,284
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

1176
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,286
For the love of...
Because I was weak.

1177
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,012
Because I was a coward,
because I wouldn’t

1178
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:33,669
- kill a dragon.
- You said "wouldn’t" that time.

1179
01:30:33,807 --> 01:30:35,568
Whatever! I wouldn’t!

1180
01:30:35,706 --> 01:30:38,191
I’m the first Viking
in who knows how long

1181
01:30:38,329 --> 01:30:40,745
who wouldn’t kill a dragon.

1182
01:30:41,919 --> 01:30:44,473
First to ride one, though.

1183
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:52,205
So?

1184
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,417
I wouldn’t kill him because...

1185
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,903
...he looked
just as frightened as I was.

1186
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,185
When I looked at him...

1187
01:31:07,323 --> 01:31:09,464
I saw myself.

1188
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,648
Bet he’s really frightened now.

1189
01:31:28,344 --> 01:31:29,967
What are you gonna do about it?

1190
01:31:30,105 --> 01:31:31,555
Eh.

1191
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,074
Probably something stupid.

1192
01:31:34,212 --> 01:31:35,904
Hmm.

1193
01:31:36,042 --> 01:31:37,871
Well, you’ve already done that.

1194
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:44,809
Then something crazy.

1195
01:31:46,397 --> 01:31:48,503
That’s more like it.

1196
01:31:54,198 --> 01:31:55,786
Sound your positions.

1197
01:31:55,924 --> 01:31:57,546
Stay within earshot.

1198
01:31:57,684 --> 01:31:59,997
One length to your stern.

1199
01:32:00,135 --> 01:32:02,378
On your starboard flank.

1200
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,588
Why aren’t they attacking?

1201
01:32:04,726 --> 01:32:06,969
Maybe they know
something we don’t.

1202
01:32:09,903 --> 01:32:11,733
Are you just a glutton
for punishment or what?

1203
01:32:11,871 --> 01:32:14,667
We have a fighting chance
this time.

1204
01:32:16,323 --> 01:32:18,567
Thanks to Hiccup.

1205
01:32:18,705 --> 01:32:20,189
How long
do you think we’re gonna...

1206
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,847
Shh.

1207
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:34,272
Step aside, Drül.

1208
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:52,428
- Ship the oars!
- Oars in.

1209
01:33:05,614 --> 01:33:07,409
Okay, wait.

1210
01:33:07,547 --> 01:33:10,895
You just disgraced yourself
in front of the whole village.

1211
01:33:11,033 --> 01:33:13,104
- Why would we listen to you?
-’Cause I said so.

1212
01:33:13,242 --> 01:33:15,313
Exactly. Pay attention, gang.

1213
01:33:15,451 --> 01:33:18,006
Look, my dad means well,
but he’s stubborn.

1214
01:33:18,144 --> 01:33:20,008
And he’s about to be
way in over his head,

1215
01:33:20,146 --> 01:33:21,112
so it’s up to us.

1216
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,666
Us?

1217
01:33:22,804 --> 01:33:24,668
I can’t pull this off
without you guys.

1218
01:33:24,806 --> 01:33:26,635
And you all have
something special to offer.

1219
01:33:26,773 --> 01:33:28,533
Say no more.

1220
01:33:28,672 --> 01:33:31,985
You were wise to seek
the world’s most deadly weapon.

1221
01:33:32,123 --> 01:33:33,538
It’s me.

1222
01:33:33,677 --> 01:33:35,023
You’ve got a wild side,
and I like it.

1223
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:36,058
Astrid, you’re
our strongest fighter.

1224
01:33:36,196 --> 01:33:37,163
We need you to lead us.

1225
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:39,510
Lead us where exactly?

1226
01:33:39,648 --> 01:33:43,100
They left
with every ship we have.

1227
01:33:45,447 --> 01:33:47,035
Stick with me.

1228
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,661
Oh.

1229
01:33:52,799 --> 01:33:55,146
That’s where that went.

1230
01:33:55,284 --> 01:33:57,977
Stay low. Be ready.

1231
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,569
We’re here.

1232
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,726
No, uh-uh.

1233
01:34:58,589 --> 01:35:01,040
Hiccup, I...

1234
01:35:01,178 --> 01:35:03,249
Relax.

1235
01:35:06,045 --> 01:35:07,115
It’s okay.

1236
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:19,575
Uh, where are you going?

1237
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,923
You’re gonna need
something to help you hold on.

1238
01:35:22,061 --> 01:35:23,890
Get ready.

1239
01:35:24,028 --> 01:35:26,030
It’s gonna be a long night.

1240
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:34,936
Form a defensive line.

1241
01:35:40,873 --> 01:35:43,254
Sharpen those axes, lads!

1242
01:35:51,366 --> 01:35:53,195
Chief.

1243
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:54,887
Ready, Chief.

1244
01:35:56,095 --> 01:35:59,684
- Stand strong.
- Aye, Stoick.

1245
01:35:59,823 --> 01:36:02,826
- Make your people proud.
- We will, Stoick.

1246
01:36:05,069 --> 01:36:07,106
Today, we destroy

1247
01:36:07,244 --> 01:36:11,420
the reign of the dragon
once and for all.

1248
01:36:15,942 --> 01:36:19,843
However this ends,
it ends right here, right now!

1249
01:36:21,637 --> 01:36:25,089
So let’s send these devils
back to hell!

1250
01:37:43,064 --> 01:37:44,720
Is that it?

1251
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,067
The nest is ours!

1252
01:37:49,829 --> 01:37:52,107
This isn’t over.

1253
01:38:00,115 --> 01:38:01,979
Get clear!

1254
01:38:02,117 --> 01:38:03,636
Fall back!

1255
01:38:03,774 --> 01:38:05,741
Fall back! Everyone, fall back!

1256
01:38:12,058 --> 01:38:13,232
Retreat!

1257
01:38:15,855 --> 01:38:17,236
Move!

1258
01:38:45,298 --> 01:38:47,404
Get to the ships!

1259
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:48,923
No!

1260
01:39:01,659 --> 01:39:03,454
Get to the far side
of the island.

1261
01:39:03,592 --> 01:39:05,284
Aye, Chief. Let’s move!

1262
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:07,976
This way! All of you!

1263
01:39:13,326 --> 01:39:15,432
- Get out of here, lads!
- Follow me!

1264
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:17,261
Gobber, go with the others.

1265
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:20,299
Why? Where are you going?

1266
01:39:27,444 --> 01:39:28,963
Actually,
I’m gonna stick around.

1267
01:39:29,101 --> 01:39:31,206
You’ve got that wild look
in your eye.

1268
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:34,485
I can buy them
some time if I give that thing

1269
01:39:34,623 --> 01:39:35,659
something to hunt.

1270
01:39:35,797 --> 01:39:37,350
And I can double that time.

1271
01:39:38,903 --> 01:39:40,698
I know. I’m a big softy.

1272
01:39:41,492 --> 01:39:44,461
Softest part of you
is your teeth.

1273
01:40:13,559 --> 01:40:17,011
Remember,
that thing is their queen.

1274
01:40:17,149 --> 01:40:18,736
They’re inclined to do
whatever it says.

1275
01:40:18,874 --> 01:40:20,635
We’ve got to help them
fight back.

1276
01:40:23,638 --> 01:40:25,019
Fishlegs, what do we got?

1277
01:40:25,157 --> 01:40:27,987
Ooh, uh, heavily armored
skull and tail,

1278
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:30,334
perfect for bashing
and crushing.

1279
01:40:30,472 --> 01:40:32,716
Small eyes, large nostrils.

1280
01:40:32,854 --> 01:40:34,787
Relies on hearing and smell.

1281
01:40:34,925 --> 01:40:37,445
- Got it. Astrid.
- Okay.

1282
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:40,517
Snotlout, Fishlegs,
hang in its blind spot.

1283
01:40:40,655 --> 01:40:43,382
Make some noise.
Keep it confused.

1284
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,005
Ruff, Tuff,
figure out its shot limit.

1285
01:40:46,143 --> 01:40:47,282
Make it mad.

1286
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,698
That’s our specialty!

1287
01:40:51,148 --> 01:40:53,116
Try not to get killed, guys!

1288
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,474
Uh, this thing doesn’t have
a blind spot.

1289
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,996
There!

1290
01:41:16,484 --> 01:41:18,762
Hey, bud.

1291
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:20,281
I’m good.

1292
01:41:20,419 --> 01:41:21,799
Be careful.

1293
01:41:26,321 --> 01:41:28,875
I know, I know,
but I’m, uh... I’m here now.

1294
01:41:41,957 --> 01:41:43,511
Keep hammering!

1295
01:41:43,649 --> 01:41:46,514
But we’re confusing
our own dragons!

1296
01:41:46,652 --> 01:41:48,654
Oh, no!

1297
01:41:54,798 --> 01:41:56,386
This way!

1298
01:41:56,524 --> 01:41:58,077
This way! Come on! Come on!

1299
01:41:58,215 --> 01:41:59,803
Guys, keep moving!
Keep moving! Come on!

1300
01:41:59,941 --> 01:42:00,873
Go!

1301
01:42:01,011 --> 01:42:02,633
Is that my kid?

1302
01:42:02,771 --> 01:42:05,360
- Snotlout!
- Come on! Throw it!

1303
01:42:07,673 --> 01:42:09,709
Whoa, girl.

1304
01:42:09,847 --> 01:42:11,504
Going down.

1305
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:15,819
I’m okay.

1306
01:42:15,957 --> 01:42:17,993
Less okay.

1307
01:42:19,995 --> 01:42:22,308
I got you, Fishlegs.

1308
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:32,353
What’s wrong?

1309
01:42:32,491 --> 01:42:34,976
Got something in your eye?

1310
01:42:35,114 --> 01:42:38,428
Yeah! Now, that’s a Top Slayer.

1311
01:43:58,232 --> 01:43:59,923
You got it, bud.

1312
01:44:05,687 --> 01:44:07,241
Hiccup.

1313
01:44:09,553 --> 01:44:12,349
I was only trying
to protect you.

1314
01:44:12,487 --> 01:44:14,938
I know, Dad.

1315
01:44:15,076 --> 01:44:17,147
Let me return the favor.

1316
01:44:19,632 --> 01:44:21,703
Whatever happens up there,

1317
01:44:21,841 --> 01:44:25,742
I’m proud to call you my son.

1318
01:44:29,711 --> 01:44:31,299
And that’s all I need.

1319
01:44:32,783 --> 01:44:34,095
Let’s go.

1320
01:44:38,306 --> 01:44:39,618
He’s up!

1321
01:44:40,895 --> 01:44:42,655
You two, get Snotlout.

1322
01:44:42,793 --> 01:44:44,243
I’ll distract the queen.

1323
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,421
That’s right. Eyes on me.

1324
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:52,976
RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT:
Snotlout!

1325
01:44:56,497 --> 01:44:57,567
Now!

1326
01:44:57,705 --> 01:45:00,155
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

1327
01:45:06,748 --> 01:45:08,371
Whoa!

1328
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:14,894
I can’t believe that worked.

1329
01:45:15,032 --> 01:45:17,241
Yeah.

1330
01:45:18,898 --> 01:45:21,660
No, no, no, girl.

1331
01:45:21,798 --> 01:45:24,318
Fight it! Don’t listen to her!

1332
01:45:24,456 --> 01:45:25,905
Shake it off!

1333
01:45:50,482 --> 01:45:52,380
Astrid.

1334
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:09,259
Did you get her?

1335
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:24,239
Go.

1336
01:46:27,242 --> 01:46:28,934
That thing has wings.

1337
01:46:29,072 --> 01:46:31,005
Let’s see if it can use them.

1338
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:48,125
You think that did it?

1339
01:46:50,369 --> 01:46:51,577
Yep.

1340
01:47:06,765 --> 01:47:09,664
All right, bud.
It’s time to disappear.

1341
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:17,465
Here it comes!

1342
01:47:22,988 --> 01:47:25,784
Quite the chief you have
in the making there.

1343
01:47:25,922 --> 01:47:27,164
Aye.

1344
01:48:08,171 --> 01:48:09,828
Watch out!

1345
01:48:13,556 --> 01:48:15,040
Okay, time’s up.

1346
01:48:15,178 --> 01:48:17,076
Let’s see if this works.

1347
01:48:22,219 --> 01:48:23,773
Is that all you’ve got?

1348
01:48:42,964 --> 01:48:44,483
Stay with me, bud!

1349
01:48:44,621 --> 01:48:46,485
Just a little bit longer!

1350
01:48:47,555 --> 01:48:49,315
Hold, Toothless!

1351
01:48:51,835 --> 01:48:53,527
Now!

1352
01:49:15,238 --> 01:49:17,447
Yeah, bud, we... No!

1353
01:49:36,604 --> 01:49:38,779
Hiccup!

1354
01:49:43,059 --> 01:49:45,095
Hiccup?

1355
01:49:45,233 --> 01:49:46,718
Son?

1356
01:49:48,547 --> 01:49:50,549
Hiccup!

1357
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:07,255
Oh, son.

1358
01:50:19,474 --> 01:50:21,476
I’m so sorry.

1359
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:35,171
Hiccup.

1360
01:51:43,213 --> 01:51:45,353
He’s alive. He’s alive!

1361
01:51:48,529 --> 01:51:50,048
Yeah!

1362
01:51:50,186 --> 01:51:52,222
Yes!

1363
01:52:03,026 --> 01:52:05,166
Thank you...

1364
01:52:06,064 --> 01:52:08,238
...for saving my son.

1365
01:52:09,584 --> 01:52:12,587
Well, you know...
most of him.

1366
01:52:28,465 --> 01:52:30,088
Hey, Toothless.

1367
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:33,332
Okay.

1368
01:52:38,821 --> 01:52:40,650
I’m in my house.

1369
01:52:42,169 --> 01:52:43,791
You-You’re in my house.

1370
01:52:43,929 --> 01:52:46,483
D-Does my dad know you’re here?

1371
01:52:46,621 --> 01:52:49,107
Oh, come on.

1372
01:53:37,017 --> 01:53:38,639
Thanks, bud.

1373
01:53:42,194 --> 01:53:44,196
Okay, here we go.

1374
01:54:13,708 --> 01:54:15,331
Toothless, stay.

1375
01:54:19,059 --> 01:54:21,785
Hey, hey, hey!
Shouldn’t you be in bed?

1376
01:54:23,511 --> 01:54:25,686
Okay. Hold on tight, guys.

1377
01:54:25,824 --> 01:54:28,137
Here we go.

1378
01:54:28,275 --> 01:54:29,966
Whoa, whoa!

1379
01:54:36,731 --> 01:54:38,319
Hey! Hey!

1380
01:54:38,457 --> 01:54:40,874
There you go!

1381
01:54:45,223 --> 01:54:48,536
- There he is! Oh, oh.
- Oh! Okay.

1382
01:54:49,399 --> 01:54:51,643
So, what do you think?

1383
01:54:51,781 --> 01:54:54,094
A few changes
since you’ve been out.

1384
01:54:54,232 --> 01:54:57,856
Flying back here was, uh, quite
an experience, let me tell you.

1385
01:54:57,994 --> 01:55:00,617
Wait, wait, you...
you rode a dragon?

1386
01:55:00,755 --> 01:55:02,102
Well... well,
that monster burned

1387
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,758
all of our ships,
so we didn’t really

1388
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:05,243
- have much of a...
- Hiccup!

1389
01:55:05,381 --> 01:55:06,692
Oh, no.

1390
01:55:06,830 --> 01:55:08,694
What’d I do this time?

1391
01:55:08,832 --> 01:55:09,764
Ow!

1392
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:11,456
That’s for scaring me.

1393
01:55:11,594 --> 01:55:13,907
Okay, is it always gonna
be like this? ’Cause...

1394
01:55:16,702 --> 01:55:19,257
And that’s for everything else.

1395
01:55:19,395 --> 01:55:22,156
You know, ’cause... ’cause I...
I-I could get used to that.

1396
01:55:22,294 --> 01:55:23,882
Yep.

1397
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:28,991
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.

1398
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:31,614
You just gestured to all of me.

1399
01:55:31,752 --> 01:55:34,720
Well, you know, most of you.

1400
01:55:34,858 --> 01:55:37,033
New leg is my handiwork
with just a dash

1401
01:55:37,171 --> 01:55:39,656
of your kooky flair
thrown in for good measure.

1402
01:55:39,794 --> 01:55:40,830
Here we go.

1403
01:55:40,968 --> 01:55:42,349
Welcome home.

1404
01:55:42,487 --> 01:55:43,764
- You rebuilt it?
- Yeah.

1405
01:55:43,902 --> 01:55:45,662
I found your designs.

1406
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,285
Not too bad.

1407
01:55:47,423 --> 01:55:49,494
Night Fury!

1408
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:51,634
- Here he is.
- What is it?

1409
01:55:51,772 --> 01:55:53,325
What is it, huh?

1410
01:55:53,463 --> 01:55:55,638
Want to take it for a spin?

1411
01:56:06,338 --> 01:56:08,823
This is Berk.

1412
01:56:10,756 --> 01:56:12,827
You’d have to be crazy
to move here.

1413
01:56:14,484 --> 01:56:16,624
Even crazier to stay.

1414
01:56:18,592 --> 01:56:21,250
It’s not for
the faint of heart.

1415
01:56:24,667 --> 01:56:26,565
Whoo!

1416
01:56:26,703 --> 01:56:28,498
Any food that grows here

1417
01:56:28,636 --> 01:56:30,845
is tough and tasteless.

1418
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:32,502
Come on!

1419
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,194
The people that grow here...

1420
01:56:34,332 --> 01:56:35,989
- Whoa!
- ...are even more so.

1421
01:56:39,544 --> 01:56:43,306
The only upsides are the pets.

1422
01:56:43,444 --> 01:56:46,758
While other places may have
ponies or puppies...

1423
01:56:46,896 --> 01:56:50,106
- Come on, bud.
- ...we have...

1424
01:56:52,902 --> 01:56:54,628
