1
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
Get up! Get up!

2
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,609
The winner, by total annihilation...

3
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,529
Yama!

4
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,841
Who is next?

5
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,124
Who has the guts to step into
the ring with Little Yama?

6
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,049
Yama!

7
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,608
Can I try?

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,004
I have a robot. I built it myself.

9
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,966
Beat it, kid.

10
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,885
House rules. You gotta pay to play.

11
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,320
Is this enough?

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,371
What's your name, little boy?

13
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,168
Hiro. Hiro Hamada.

14
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,968
Prepare your bot, Zero.

15
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,410
Two bots enter,

16
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,688
one bot leaves.

17
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,801
Fighters ready?

18
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,161
Fight!

19
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,166
That was my first fight.
I... Can I try again?

20
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,210
No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

21
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,090
Go home.

22
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,725
I've got more money.

23
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,204
Fighters ready?

24
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,851
Fight!

25
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,122
Mega-bot, destroy.

26
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,686
What?

27
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,491
- No more Little Yama.
- But, wha...

28
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,290
This is not possible!

29
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,088
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

30
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,651
Beginner's luck.

31
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,167
Do you want to go again, Yama?

32
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,122
- No one hustles Yama!
- Whoa. Hey...

33
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,728
Teach him a lesson.

34
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,846
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

35
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,809
- Hiro! Get on!
- Tadashi!

36
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,441
Good timing!

37
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,681
Oh, mama!

38
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,446
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,766
- Are you hurt?
- No.

40
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,844
Then what were you thinking,
knucklehead?

41
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,605
You graduated high school
when you were 13,

42
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,727
and this is what you're doing?

43
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,801
There they are!

44
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,041
Hey!

45
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,363
Hold on!

46
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,601
Yes!

47
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,171
Get back here.

48
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,281
Bot fighting is illegal.

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,124
You're going to get yourself arrested.

50
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,288
Bot fighting is not illegal.

51
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,801
Betting on bot fighting,
that's... that's illegal.

52
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,001
But so lucrative!

53
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,483
I'm on a roll, big brother!
And there is no stopping me!

54
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,481
Oh, no.

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,801
Hi, Aunt Cass.

56
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,889
Are you guys okay?
Tell me you're okay.

57
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,486
- We're fine.
- We're okay.

58
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,806
Oh, good.

59
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,849
Then what were you
two knuckleheads thinking?

60
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,401
For 10 years,

61
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,482
I have done the best I could
to raise you.

62
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,371
Have I been perfect? No.

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,409
Do I know anything about children? No.

64
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,324
Should I have picked up a book
on parenting?

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,686
Probably!

66
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,001
Where was I going with this?
I had a point.

67
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,202
- Sorry.
- We love you, Aunt Cass.

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,771
Well, I love you, too!

69
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,849
I had to close up early
because of you two felons.

70
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,162
On beat poetry night.

71
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,925
Stress eating. Because of you.

72
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,164
Come on, Mochi.

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,364
This is really good!

74
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,210
You better make this up to Aunt Cass
before she eats everything in the cafe.

75
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,486
For sure.

76
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,761
And I hope you learned
your lesson, bonehead.

77
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,851
Absolutely.

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,680
You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

79
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,201
There's a fight across town.
If I book, I can still make it.

80
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,086
When are you gonna
start doing something

81
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,605
with that big brain of yours?

82
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,530
What? Go to college like you?

83
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,404
So people can tell me stuff
I already know?

84
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,247
Unbelievable.

85
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,883
What would Mom and Dad say?

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,121
I don't know.

87
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,884
They're gone.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,206
They died when I was three, remember?

89
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,521
Hey!

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,962
- I'll take you.
- Really?

91
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,287
I can't stop you from going,

92
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,726
but I'm not going
to let you go on your own.

93
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,007
Sweet.

94
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,728
What are we doing at your nerd school?

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,405
Bot-fight's that way!

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,971
Gotta grab something.

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,646
Is this gonna take long?

98
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,127
Relax, you big baby.
We'll be in and out.

99
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,771
Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,570
Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

101
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,841
Heads up!

102
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,491
Electro-mag suspension?

103
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,801
Hey!

104
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,130
- Who are you?
- I'm...

105
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,203
Go Go, this is my brother Hiro.

106
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,843
Welcome to the nerd lab.

107
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,601
Yeah.

108
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,491
I've never seen electro-mag
suspension on a bike before.

109
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,161
Zero resistance, faster bike.

110
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,004
But, not fast enough...

111
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,566
...yet.

112
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,003
Do not move. Behind the line, please.

113
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,802
Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

114
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,406
Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

115
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,481
Catch.

116
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,527
Wow.

117
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,481
- Laser-induced plasma?
- Oh, yeah.

118
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,441
With a little magnetic confinement
for ultra-precision.

119
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,649
Wow. How do you find anything
in this mess?

120
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,641
I have a system.

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,768
There's a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

122
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,251
- Need this!
- You can't do that!

123
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,482
This is anarchy! Society has rules!

124
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,324
Excuse me!

125
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,931
Coming through!

126
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,606
Tadashi!

127
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,730
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

128
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,884
I've heard so much about you!

129
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,169
Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

130
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,724
That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.

131
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,530
400 pounds of it!

132
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,846
Come here, come here, come here.

133
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,605
You're going to love this.

134
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,889
A dash of perchloric acid,
a smidge of cobalt,

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,561
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,200
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and...

137
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,682
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

138
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,200
It's so pink.

139
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,124
Here's the best part.

140
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,884
I know, right?

141
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,249
Chemical metal embrittlement.

142
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,885
Not bad, Honey Lemon.

143
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,726
"Honey Lemon"? "Go Go"? "Wasabi"?

144
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,890
I spill wasabi on my shirt
one time, people.

145
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,406
One time!

146
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,648
Fred is the one who comes up
with the nicknames.

147
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,245
Who's Fred?

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,771
This guy, right here!

149
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,487
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit.

150
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,085
This is not my real face and body.

151
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,327
The name's Fred.

152
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,404
School mascot by day, but by night...

153
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,485
I am also a school mascot.

154
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,085
So, what's your major?

155
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,566
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

156
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,764
But I am a major science enthusiast.

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,968
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

158
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,090
that can turn me into
a fire-breathing lizard at will.

159
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,527
But she says that's "not science."

160
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,761
It's really not.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,490
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

162
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,444
I asked Wasabi for
isn't "science" either.

163
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,647
- Is it?
- Nope.

164
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,485
Well, then, what about
"invisible sandwich"?

165
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,688
- Hiro.
- Imagine eating a sandwich,

166
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,769
but everybody just thinks you're crazy.

167
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,887
Just stop.

168
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,201
- Laser eyes?
- What?

169
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,124
- Tingly fingers?
- Never gonna happen.

170
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,327
Hey, what about a growth serum?

171
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,443
So, what have you been working on?

172
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,761
I'll show you.

173
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,970
Duct tape?

174
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,889
I hate to break it to you, bro.

175
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,166
Already been invented.

176
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,447
Hey!

177
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,721
Dude!

178
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,801
Ow!

179
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,007
This is what I've been working on.

180
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,522
Hello. I am Baymax.

181
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,081
Your personal healthcare companion.

182
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,526
I was alerted to the need

183
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,002
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

184
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,322
A robotic nurse.

185
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,322
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

186
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,330
Physical or emotional?

187
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,686
I will scan you now.

188
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,009
Scan complete.

189
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,722
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

190
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,441
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray.

191
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,084
What's in the spray, specifically?

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,204
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,846
That's a bummer.
I'm actually allergic to that.

194
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,929
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

195
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,248
You do have a mild allergy to

196
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,521
peanuts.

197
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,210
Not bad.

198
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,886
You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

199
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,044
Programed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

200
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,727
This chip is what
makes Baymax, Baymax.

201
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,561
Vinyl?

202
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,809
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

203
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,042
Looks like a walking marshmallow.

204
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,651
- No offense.
- I am a robot.

205
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,041
I cannot be offended.

206
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,247
- Hyperspectral cameras?
- Yep.

207
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,929
- Titanium skeleton?
- Carbon fiber.

208
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,288
Right. Even lighter.

209
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,727
Killer actuators.
Where did you get those?

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,490
Machined them right here, in-house.

211
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,926
- Really?
- Yup.

212
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,570
He can lift 1,000 pounds.

213
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,721
Shut up.

214
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,403
You have been a good boy.
Have a lollipop.

215
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,766
Nice.

216
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,325
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

217
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,331
Well then, I'm satisfied with my care.

218
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,489
He's going to help a lot of people.

219
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,607
Hey, what kind of battery does it use?

220
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,761
Lithium ion.

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,606
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

222
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,850
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada?

223
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,921
Hey, Professor.

224
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,969
Actually, I was just finishing up.

225
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,287
You must be Hiro.

226
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,931
Bot-fighter, right?

227
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,767
When my daughter was younger,
that's all she wanted to do.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,047
May I?

229
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,486
Sure.

230
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,970
Magnetic-bearing servos.

231
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,326
Pretty sick, huh?

232
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,641
Wanna see how I put 'em together?

233
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,206
Hey, genius!

234
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,169
He invented them.

235
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,647
You're Robert Callaghan?

236
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,450
Like, as in,

237
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,329
the Callaghan-Catmull spline,

238
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,965
and Callaghan's "Laws of Robotics?"

239
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,161
That's right.

240
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,004
Ever think about applying here?

241
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,566
Your age wouldn't be an issue.

242
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,801
I don't know.

243
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,123
He's pretty serious about
his career in bot-fighting.

244
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,646
Well, kind of serious.

245
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,841
I can see why.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,968
With your bot, winning must come easy.

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,890
Yeah, I guess.

248
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,410
Well, if you like things easy,
then my program isn't for you.

249
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,881
We push the boundaries
of robotics here.

250
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,527
My students go on to shape the future.

251
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,325
Nice to meet you, Hiro.

252
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,931
Good luck with the bot-fights.

253
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,846
We gotta hurry if you
want to catch that bot-fight.

254
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,645
I have to go here.

255
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,330
If I don't go to this nerd school,

256
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,726
I'm gonna lose my mind.

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,126
How do I get in?

258
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,089
Every year, the school has
a student showcase.

259
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,803
You come up with something
that blows Callaghan away, you're in.

260
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,604
But, it's gotta be great.

261
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,001
Trust me.

262
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,211
It will be.

263
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,601
Nothing!

264
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,889
No ideas! Useless, empty brain!

265
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,203
Wow. Washed up at 14.

266
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,327
So sad.

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,211
I got nothing! I'm done.
I'm never getting in.

268
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,205
Hey, I'm not giving up on you.

269
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,246
What are you doing?

270
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,726
Shake things up.

271
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,201
Use that big brain of yours
to think your way out.

272
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,408
- What?
- Look for a new angle.

273
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,087
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today.

274
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,441
How are you feeling?

275
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,127
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter.
Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.

276
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,322
Yep, he's nervous.

277
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,766
You have nothing to fear, little fellow.

278
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,605
- He's so tense.
- No, I'm not.

279
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,285
Relax, Hiro.

280
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,205
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go Go.

281
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,482
- Stop whining. Woman up.
- I'm fine!

282
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,451
What do you need, little man?
Deodorant? Breath mint?

283
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,601
Fresh pair of underpants?

284
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,689
Underpants? You need serious help.

285
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,881
Hey, I come prepared.

286
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,009
I haven't done laundry in six months.

287
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,287
One pair lasts me four days.

288
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,801
I go front, I go back, I go inside-out.

289
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,644
Then I go front and back.

290
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,042
Wow. That is both
disgusting and awesome.

291
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,406
Don't encourage him.

292
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,971
It's called "recycling."

293
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,731
<i>Next presenter, Hiro Hamada.</i>

294
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,689
Oh, yeah. This is it.

295
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,841
I guess I'm up.

296
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,161
Okay, photo, photo!
Everybody say, "Hiro."

297
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,725
- Hiro!
- Yeah!

298
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,486
We love you, Hiro. Good luck!

299
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,085
- Don't mess it up.
- Break a leg, little man.

300
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,691
Science, yeah!

301
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,008
All right, bro. This is it.

302
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,568
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

303
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,640
What's going on?

304
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,207
I really want to go here.

305
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,881
Hey.

306
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,002
You got this.

307
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,680
<i>Hi.</i>

308
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,163
<i>My name is Hiro...</i>

309
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,806
<i>Sorry.</i>

310
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,641
<i>My name is Hiro Hamada,</i>

311
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,209
<i>and I've been working on something
that I think is pretty cool.</i>

312
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,204
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

313
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,044
<i>This is a microbot.</i>

314
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,323
Breathe.

315
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,571
<i>It doesn't look like much,</i>

316
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,927
<i>but when it links up
with the rest of its pals...</i>

317
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,411
<i>...things get a little more interesting.</i>

318
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,802
<i>The microbots are controlled
with this neural transmitter.</i>

319
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,401
<i>I think what I want them to do...</i>

320
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,446
<i>They do it.</i>

321
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,764
<i>The applications for this tech
are limitless.</i>

322
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,405
<i>Construction.</i>

323
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,251
<i>What used to take teams
of people working by hand</i>

324
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,646
<i>for months or years,</i>

325
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,451
<i>can now be accomplished
by one person.</i>

326
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,930
<i>And that's just the beginning.</i>

327
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,650
<i>How about transportation?</i>

328
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,288
<i>Microbots can move
anything anywhere,</i>

329
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,084
<i>with ease.</i>

330
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,443
<i>If you can think it,
the microbots can do it.</i>

331
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,481
<i>The only limit is your imagination.</i>

332
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,809
<i>Microbots!</i>

333
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,291
That's my nephew!

334
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,567
Yes!

335
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,366
My family! I love my family!

336
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,166
Nailed it!

337
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,169
- You did it!
- Not bad!

338
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,170
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude!

339
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,641
They loved you. That was amazing!

340
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,160
Yes.

341
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,445
With some development,
your tech could be revolutionary.

342
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,725
Alistair Krei!

343
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,327
May I?

344
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,008
Extraordinary.

345
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,369
I want your microbots at Krei Tech.

346
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,050
Shut up.

347
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,725
Mr. Krei is right.

348
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,725
Your microbots are
an inspired piece of tech.

349
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,530
You can continue to develop them,

350
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,205
or you can sell them to a man

351
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,402
who's only guided
by his own self-interest.

352
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,325
Robert, I know how you feel about me,

353
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,567
but it shouldn't affect...

354
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,370
This is your decision, Hiro.

355
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,561
But you should know

356
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,530
Mr. Krei has cut corners
and ignored sound science

357
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,721
to get where he is.

358
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,001
That's just not true.

359
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,765
I wouldn't trust Krei Tech
with your microbots,

360
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,368
or anything else.

361
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,930
Hiro, I'm offering you more money
than any 14-year-old could imagine.

362
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,363
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei,
but they're not for sale.

363
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,289
I thought you were smarter than that.

364
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,845
Robert.

365
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,931
Mr. Krei.

366
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,291
That's my brother's.

367
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,724
That's right.

368
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,089
I look forward to seeing you in class.

369
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,763
Unbelievable!

370
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,001
That's what I'm talking about.

371
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,242
All right, geniuses,
let's feed those hungry brains.

372
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,401
Back to the café!

373
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,762
Dinner is on me!

374
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,763
Yes! Nothing is better than free food!

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,764
- Aunt Cass?
- Unless it's moldy.

376
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,246
We'll... We'll catch up, okay?

377
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,602
Sure. I'm so proud of you.

378
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,484
Both of you.

379
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,802
Thanks, Aunt Cass.

380
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,165
I know what you're going to say.

381
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,084
"I should be proud of myself,"

382
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,011
"because I'm finally using my gift
for something important."

383
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,925
No, no. I was just gonna tell you
your fly was down for the whole show.

384
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,009
Ha-ha-hilarious.

385
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,971
What?

386
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,006
Welcome to nerd school, nerd.

387
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,331
Hey, I, um...

388
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,285
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you. So,

389
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,325
you know,

390
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,325
thanks for not giving up on me.

391
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,007
Are you okay?

392
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,645
Yeah. I'm okay.

393
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,446
But Professor Callaghan is still in there.

394
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,331
Tadashi, no!

395
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,290
Callaghan's in there.

396
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,682
Someone has to help.

397
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,684
Tadashi!

398
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,369
Tadashi!

399
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,924
Here. Have some tea.

400
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,124
Hey, sweetie.

401
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,561
Hey, Aunt Cass.

402
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,484
Mrs. Matsuda's in the café.

403
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,967
She's wearing something
super inappropriate for an 80-year-old.

404
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,285
That always cracks you up.

405
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,483
You should come down.

406
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,850
Maybe later.

407
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,925
The university called again.

408
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,164
It's been a few weeks
since classes started.

409
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,602
But they said it's not too late to register.

410
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,369
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

411
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,841
<i>Hey, Hiro.</i>

412
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,731
<i>We just wanted to check in,
and see how you're doing.</i>

413
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,961
<i>We wish you were here, buddy.</i>

414
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,005
<i>Hiro, if I could have only
one superpower right now,</i>

415
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,561
<i>it would be the ability
to crawl through this camera,</i>

416
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,006
<i>and give you a big hug.</i>

417
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,721
Ow!

418
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,922
Hello. I am Baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

419
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,930
Hey, Baymax.

420
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,765
I didn't know you were still active.

421
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,928
I heard a sound of distress.

422
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,531
What seems to be the trouble?

423
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,643
I just stubbed my toe a little.

424
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,006
I'm fine.

425
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,082
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

426
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,081
A zero. I'm okay, really.

427
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,163
Thanks. You can shrink now.

428
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,851
Does it hurt when I touch it?

429
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,809
That's okay. No touching.

430
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,485
I'm fine...

431
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,321
Ow.

432
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,921
You have fallen.

433
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,121
You think?

434
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,606
- On a scale of 1 to...
- Ow!

435
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,001
On a scale...

436
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,161
On a sca...

437
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,482
On a scale of 1 to 10...

438
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,162
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

439
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,966
Zero.

440
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,322
- It is all right to cry.
- No. No, no, no, no.

441
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,125
Crying is a natural response to pain.

442
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,281
I'm not crying.

443
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,807
- I will scan you for injuries.
- Don't scan me.

444
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,650
- Scan complete.
- Unbelievable.

445
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,649
You have sustained no injuries.

446
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,326
However, your hormone
and neurotransmitter levels

447
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,325
indicate that you are
experiencing mood swings

448
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,686
common in adolescence.

449
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,321
Diagnosis, puberty.

450
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,641
What?

451
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,247
Okay. Time to shrink now.

452
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,369
You should expect an increase
in body hair,

453
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,002
especially on your face,
chest, armpits, and...

454
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,366
Thank you! That's enough.

455
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,171
You may also experience
strange and powerful new urges.

456
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,164
Okay! Let's get you
back in your luggage.

457
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,325
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

458
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,006
Fine. I'm satisfied with my...

459
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,370
My microbot?

460
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,843
This doesn't make any sense.

461
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,327
Puberty can often be a confusing time

462
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,522
for a young adolescent
flowering into manhood.

463
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,525
No. The thing is attracted
to the other microbots,

464
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,529
but that's impossible.

465
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,682
They were destroyed in the fire.

466
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,887
Dumb thing's broken.

467
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,041
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

468
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,201
Oh, yeah?

469
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,886
Why don't you find out
where it's trying to go?

470
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,566
Would that stabilize
your pubescent mood swings?

471
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,085
Absolutely.

472
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,046
Baymax?

473
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,250
Baymax?

474
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,526
Baymax?

475
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,246
What?

476
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,362
- Hiro?
- Hey, Aunt Cass!

477
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,761
Wow. You're up and...

478
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,769
Yeah! I figured it was time.

479
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,769
Are you registering for school?

480
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,921
Yes.

481
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,810
I thought about what you said.
Really inspired me.

482
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,247
Oh, honey, that's so great.

483
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,721
Okay,

484
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,126
special dinner tonight.

485
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,640
I'll whip up some chicken wings.

486
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,287
You know, with the hot sauce
that makes our faces numb.

487
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,130
- Okay, sounds good.
- Great!

488
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,760
Last hug.

489
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,926
Baymax!

490
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,086
- Baymax!
- Hey!

491
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,361
Watch it!

492
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,641
Baymax!

493
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,126
Baymax!

494
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,971
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

495
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,731
I have found where
your tiny robot wants to go.

496
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,331
I told you, it's broken.
It's not trying to go...

497
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,531
Locked.

498
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,728
There is a window.

499
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,688
Please exercise caution.

500
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,241
A fall from this height
could lead to bodily harm.

501
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,201
Oh, no.

502
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,201
Excuse me while I let out some air.

503
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,441
Are you done?

504
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,201
Yes.

505
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,929
It will take me a moment to re-inflate.

506
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,521
Fine, just keep it down.

507
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,404
My microbots?

508
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,961
Someone's making more.

509
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,166
Hiro?

510
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,608
You gave me a heart attack!

511
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,963
My hands are equipped
with defibrillators. Clear.

512
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,801
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression.

513
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,163
Oh, no.

514
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,486
Run!

515
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,650
Oh, come on!

516
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,161
I am not fast.

517
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,844
Yeah, no kidding!

518
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,441
Go! Go! Come on.

519
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,880
Kick it down!

520
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,808
Then punch it!

521
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,966
Go! Go!

522
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,328
Oh, come on! Go, go, go!

523
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,647
Move it!

524
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,646
Come on!

525
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,168
No, no.

526
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,242
Come on! The window!

527
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,326
Suck it in!

528
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,200
Baymax!

529
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,891
Hiro?

530
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,926
Come on, let's get out of here.

531
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,849
Go! Hurry!

532
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,968
All right, let me get this straight.

533
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,090
A man in a kabuki mask attacked you,

534
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,408
with an army of miniature flying robots.

535
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,041
"Microbots."

536
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,209
- Microbots.
- Yeah.

537
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,121
He was controlling them telepathically
with a neurocranial transmitter.

538
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,046
So, Mr. Kabuki was using ESP

539
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,925
to attack you and balloon man.

540
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,684
Did you file a report
when your flying robots were stolen?

541
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,968
No. I thought they were all destroyed.

542
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,164
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but Baymax was there, too.

543
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,284
- Tell him.
- Yes, Officer.

544
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,324
He's telling the truth.

545
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,609
What the... What's wrong with you?

546
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,480
Low battery.

547
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,330
Try to keep it together.

548
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,445
I'm healthcare,
your personal Baymax companion.

549
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,166
Kid, how about we call your parents

550
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,482
- and get them down here?
- What?

551
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,122
Write your name and number down
on this piece of paper, and we can...

552
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,007
I've gotta get you home
to your charging station.

553
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,961
Can you walk?

554
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,004
I will scan you now. Scan complete.

555
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,523
Healthcare.

556
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,641
Okay.

557
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,242
If my aunt asks,
we were at school all day. Got it?

558
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,721
We jumped out a window.

559
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,604
No! Quiet!

560
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,524
We jumped out a window.

561
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,883
You can't say things like that
around Aunt Cass.

562
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,161
Hiro?

563
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,521
You home, sweetie?

564
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,567
That's right.

565
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,206
I thought I heard you. Hi.

566
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,528
Hey, Aunt Cass.

567
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,843
Look at my little college man.

568
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,042
I can't wait to hear all about it!

569
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,401
And wings are almost ready.

570
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,487
Whee!

571
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,561
Will you be quiet?

572
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,530
Yeah, wings! Whee!

573
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,401
All right, get ready to have
your face melted.

574
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,566
We are gonna feel
these things tomorrow.

575
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,091
You know what I'm saying?

576
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,241
Okay.

577
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,727
Sit down. Tell me everything.

578
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,442
The thing is that,
since I registered so late,

579
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,961
I've got a lot of school stuff
to catch up on.

580
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,446
What was that?

581
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,245
Mochi.

582
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,721
That darn cat.

583
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,407
At least take a plate for the road, okay?

584
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,771
- Don't work too...
- Thanks for understanding.

585
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,970
Hairy baby. Hairy baby.

586
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,204
All right, come on.

587
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,210
I'm healthcare,
your personal Baymax companion.

588
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,521
One foot in front of the other.

589
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,527
This doesn't make any sense.

590
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,044
Tadashi.

591
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,206
What?

592
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,850
Tadashi.

593
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,805
Tadashi's gone.

594
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,242
When will he return?

595
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,642
He's dead, Baymax.

596
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,486
Tadashi was in excellent health.

597
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,845
With a proper diet and exercise,
he should have lived a long life.

598
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,766
Yeah, he should have.

599
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,209
But there was a fire and...

600
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,411
Now, he's gone.

601
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,881
- Tadashi is here.
- No.

602
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,521
People keep saying
he's not really gone.

603
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,003
As long as we remember him.

604
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,529
It still hurts.

605
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,530
I see no evidence of physical injury.

606
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,404
It's a different kind of hurt.

607
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,680
You are my patient.

608
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,200
I would like to help.

609
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,371
You can't fix this one, buddy.

610
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,241
What are you doing?

611
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,609
I am downloading
a database on personal loss.

612
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,280
Database downloaded.

613
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,882
Treatments include contact
with friends and loved ones.

614
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,406
I am contacting them now.

615
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,045
No, no, no! I... Don't do that.

616
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,480
Your friends have been contacted.

617
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,404
Unbelievable.

618
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,287
Now, what are you doing?

619
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,241
Other treatments include
compassion and physical reassurance.

620
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,720
I'm okay. Really.

621
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,009
You will be all right. There, there.

622
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,651
Thanks, Baymax.

623
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,282
I am sorry about the fire.

624
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,410
It's okay. It was an accident.

625
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,726
Unless...

626
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,044
Unless it wasn't.

627
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,564
At the showcase,

628
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,200
that guy in the mask
stole my microbots. And...

629
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,920
And then set the fire to cover his tracks.

630
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,010
He's responsible for Tadashi.

631
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,449
We gotta catch that guy.

632
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,691
<i>It's alive!</i>

633
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,287
<i>It's alive, it's alive! It's alive!</i>

634
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,646
If we're gonna catch that guy,

635
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,445
you need some upgrades.

636
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,210
Will apprehending the man in the mask
improve your emotional state?

637
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,044
Absolutely.

638
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,846
Let's work on your moves.

639
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,961
Now, let's take care of this.

640
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,923
I have some concerns.

641
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,926
This armor may undermine
my non-threatening, huggable design.

642
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,844
That's kind of the idea, buddy.

643
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,967
You look sick.

644
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,161
I cannot be sick. I am a robot.

645
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,885
It's just an expression.

646
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,162
<i>Data transfer complete.</i>

647
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,803
I fail to see how karate makes me
a better healthcare companion.

648
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,482
You want to keep me healthy,
don't you?

649
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,846
Punch this.

650
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,723
Yes! Hammerfist!

651
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,481
Side kick!

652
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,846
Knifehand!

653
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,491
Back kick!

654
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,561
Gummy bears!

655
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,007
Yes!

656
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,210
Yeah! Fist bump!

657
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,080
"Fist bump" is not in
my fighting database.

658
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,688
No, this isn't a fighting thing.

659
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,002
It's what people do sometimes

660
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,807
when they're excited or pumped up.

661
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,965
Hey, now you're getting it.

662
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,646
I will add "fist bump"
to my care-giving matrix.

663
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,161
All right. Let's go get that guy.

664
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,245
Come on!

665
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,251
Get him, Baymax!

666
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,649
We're too late.

667
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,403
Your tiny robot
is trying to go somewhere.

668
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,325
Come on.

669
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,763
Always wait one hour after eating
before swimming.

670
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,121
Hey!

671
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,285
Come on!

672
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,285
Your heart rate has
increased dramatic...

673
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,922
Okay, Baymax,
time to use those upgrades.

674
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,331
- Hiro?
- No, no, no!

675
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,766
Get out of here! Go!

676
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,530
Dude, what are you doing out here?

677
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,166
Nothing! Just out for a walk.

678
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,004
Helps my pubescent mood swings.

679
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,287
Is that Baymax?

680
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,045
Yeah, but you really...

681
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,846
Why is he wearing
carbon fiber underpants?

682
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,605
I also know karate.

683
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,927
You guys need to go.

684
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,970
No, don't push us away, Hiro.
We're here for you.

685
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,645
That's why Baymax contacted us.

686
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,120
Those who suffer a loss,

687
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,567
require support
from friends and loved ones.

688
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,767
Okay, but I...

689
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,683
Who would like
to share their feelings first?

690
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,370
I'll go. Okay.

691
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,001
My name is Fred, and it has
been 30 days since my last...

692
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,884
Holy mother of Megazon!

693
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,808
Am I the only one seeing this?

694
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,125
Oh, my gosh! Oh, no!

695
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,961
Go!

696
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,485
Baymax, get him!

697
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,964
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing?

698
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,406
I'm saving your life.

699
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,807
Baymax can handle that guy!

700
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,361
Oh, no.

701
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,280
Wasabi!

702
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,005
Goodbye!

703
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,924
Hiro. Explanation. Now.

704
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,771
He stole my microbots.
He started the fire.

705
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,405
I don't know who he is!

706
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,121
Baymax, palm-heel strike!

707
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,321
Hard left!

708
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,881
That mask, the black suit...

709
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,202
We're under attack
from a super villain, people!

710
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,965
I mean, how cool is that?

711
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,242
I mean, it's scary, obviously.
But how cool!

712
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,805
Why are we stopped?

713
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,881
The light's red!

714
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,521
There are no red lights in a car chase!

715
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,490
Why is he trying to kill us?

716
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,848
Why are you trying to kill us?

717
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,565
It's classic villain.
We've seen too much!

718
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,211
Let's not jump to conclusions.

719
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,204
We don't know he's trying to kill us.

720
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,441
Car!

721
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,851
He's trying to kill us!

722
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,205
Did you just put your blinker on?

723
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,805
You have to indicate your turn!

724
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,086
It's the law!

725
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,124
That's it.

726
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,881
Stop the car!

727
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,201
Baymax and I can take this guy!

728
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,530
Seatbelts save lives.

729
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,171
Buckle up, every time.

730
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,002
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

731
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,728
- Did we lose him?
- Look out!

732
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,326
Baymax, hold on!

733
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:57,126
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're gonna make it!

734
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,124
We made it! Yes!

735
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,688
I told you we'd make it!

736
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,922
Your injuries require my attention.

737
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,128
And your body temperatures are low.

738
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,847
We should get out of here.

739
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,889
I know a place.

740
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,931
Where are we?

741
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,771
Fred.

742
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,240
Where are you going?

743
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,410
Welcome to <i>mi casa.</i>

744
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,244
That's French for "front door."

745
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,084
It's really not.

746
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,401
Listen, nitwit.

747
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,086
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

748
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,685
I'm not in the mood for any...

749
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,362
Welcome home, Master Frederick.

750
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,250
Heathcliff, my man!

751
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,722
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here.

752
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,007
Gimme some.

753
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,851
Freddie,

754
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,850
this is your house?

755
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,804
I thought you lived under a bridge.

756
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,849
Well, technically,
it belongs to my parents.

757
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,129
They're on a vacay on the family island.

758
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,726
You know, we should
totally go some time. Frolic.

759
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,530
You gotta be kidding me.

760
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,365
If I wasn't just attacked
by a guy in a kabuki mask,

761
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,041
I think this would be
the weirdest thing I've seen today.

762
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,287
My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.

763
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,885
Your body temperature is still low.

764
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,926
Yeah.

765
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,486
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

766
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,329
It's so nice.

767
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,164
Oh, yeah, that's toasty.

768
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,968
Good robot.

769
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,768
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

770
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,964
- Yes! It's a bird!
- No!

771
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,409
The guy in the mask was carrying
something with this symbol on it.

772
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,729
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

773
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,485
Apprehend him?

774
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,000
We don't even know who he is.

775
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,765
I have a theory.

776
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,803
"Dr. Slaughter, MD"?

777
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,048
Actually, millionaire weapons designer,

778
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,531
Malcolm Chazzletick.

779
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,041
"The Annihilator"?

780
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,806
Behind the mask,
industrialist Reid Axworthy.

781
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,008
"Baron von Destruct"?
Just get to the point!

782
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,361
Don't you guys get it?

783
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,807
The man in the mask who attacked us

784
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,371
is none other than...

785
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,041
<i>Voilà!</i>

786
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,366
Alistair Krei.

787
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,090
- What?
- Think about it.

788
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,687
Krei wanted your microbots,
and you said no.

789
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,321
But rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

790
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,371
There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.

791
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,404
Then who was that guy in the mask?

792
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,210
I don't know.

793
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,402
We don't know anything about him.

794
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,881
His blood type is AB-negative.

795
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,406
Cholesterol levels are...

796
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,727
Baymax, you scanned him?

797
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,804
I am programed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

798
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,365
Yes!

799
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,927
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

800
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,731
You'd have to scan
everyone in San Fransokyo.

801
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,884
That might take, I don't know, forever.

802
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,531
No, no, no, no. I...

803
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,762
I just have to look for another angle.

804
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,407
Got it!

805
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,608
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

806
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,127
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

807
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,043
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

808
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,609
I need to upgrade all of you.

809
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,927
Upgrade who, now?

810
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,563
Those who suffer a loss require support
from friends and loved ones.

811
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,121
Okay, I like where this is heading!

812
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,806
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

813
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,371
Hiro, we want to help,

814
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,529
but we're just us.

815
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,841
No.

816
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,203
You can be way more.

817
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,725
Tadashi Hamada was our best friend.

818
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,845
We're in.

819
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,448
Can you feel it?
You guys, do you feel this?

820
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,523
Our origin story begins.

821
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,842
We're gonna be superheroes!

822
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,926
Arms up.

823
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,323
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.

824
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,689
We get the mask,
and he can't control the bots.

825
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,881
Game over.

826
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,003
<i>They say
"We are what we are"</i>

827
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,844
<i>But we don't have to be</i>

828
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,809
<i>I'm bad behavior</i>

829
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,566
<i>But I do it in the best way</i>

830
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,808
<i>I'll be the watcher</i>

831
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,525
<i>Of the eternal flame</i>

832
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,082
<i>I'll be the guard dog</i>

833
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,084
<i>Of all your fever dreams</i>

834
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,687
<i>I am the sand in the bottom
half of the hourglass</i>

835
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,606
<i>'Cause we could be immortals</i>

836
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,761
<i>Immortals</i>

837
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,361
<i>Just not for long</i>

838
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,522
<i>For long</i>

839
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,205
<i>Live with me forever now</i>

840
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,568
<i>Pull the blackout curtains down</i>

841
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,842
<i>Just not for long
For long</i>

842
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,841
<i>We could be immortals</i>

843
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,530
<i>Immortals</i>

844
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,122
<i>Immortals</i>

845
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,606
<i>Immortals</i>

846
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,768
<i>Sometimes the only payoff</i>

847
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,167
<i>For having any faith</i>

848
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,442
<i>Is when it's tested again</i>

849
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,926
<i>And again
Every day</i>

850
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,928
<i>I'm still comparing your past</i>

851
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,088
<i>To my future</i>

852
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,808
<i>'Cause we could be immortals</i>

853
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,651
<i>Immortals</i>

854
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,690
<i>Just not for long
For long</i>

855
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,490
Super Jump!

856
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,681
Super Jump!

857
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,921
<i>And live with me forever now</i>

858
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,570
<i>Pull the blackout curtains down</i>

859
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,449
- I breathe fire.
<i>- Just not for long</i>

860
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,681
<i>For long</i>

861
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:18,250
<i>We could be immortals
Immortals</i>

862
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,447
<i>Immortals</i>

863
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,604
<i>Immortals</i>

864
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,970
<i>Immortals</i>

865
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,405
<i>Immortals</i>

866
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,445
<i>Immortals</i>

867
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,488
<i>Immortals</i>

868
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,127
I love it!

869
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,326
Not bad.

870
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,329
Anybody else's suit riding up on them?

871
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,447
Hey, guys!

872
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,524
Check this out.

873
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,205
I'd like to introduce,

874
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,330
Baymax 2.0.

875
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,842
He's glorious.

876
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,405
Hello.

877
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,487
Hold up. Focus.

878
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,882
Show 'em what you got, buddy.

879
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,327
The fist, show them the fist.

880
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,484
No, not that.

881
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,405
The thing, the other thing.

882
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,723
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy!

883
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,282
That's just one of his new upgrades!

884
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,204
Baymax, wings.

885
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,048
No way!

886
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,690
Thrusters.

887
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,286
I fail to see how flying

888
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,363
makes me a better
healthcare companion.

889
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,649
I fail to see how you fail to see
that it's awesome!

890
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,206
Full thrust.

891
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,601
Steady, big guy.

892
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,530
Look, let's just take this slow.

893
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,688
Up, up, up, up, up!

894
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,126
Thrust, thrust, thrust!

895
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,930
Too much thrust! Too much thrust!

896
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,525
Too much thrust!

897
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,961
No, no, no, no!

898
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,207
Back on! Back on!

899
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,606
On! On! On!

900
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,611
Zoom...

901
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,290
Go up! Up, up, up!

902
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,361
Up!

903
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,845
Oh, man!

904
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,928
Maybe...
Maybe enough flying for today.

905
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,244
What do you say?

906
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,051
Your neurotransmitter levels
are rising steadily.

907
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,521
Which means what?

908
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,163
The treatment is working.

909
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,731
Oh, no!

910
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,286
No, no, no, no, no!

911
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,244
Whoa, Baymax!

912
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,961
Yes!

913
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,881
Yeah!

914
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,166
Yes!

915
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,001
Wow!

916
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,121
That was...

917
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,245
That was...

918
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,926
Sick.

919
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,127
It is just an expression.

920
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,362
That's... That's right, buddy.

921
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,205
I am never taking the bus again.

922
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,285
Your emotional state has improved.

923
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,321
I can deactivate if you say
you are satisfied with your care.

924
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,245
What?

925
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,084
No, I don't want you to deactivate.

926
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,724
We still have to find that guy.

927
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,882
So, fire up that super-sensor.

928
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,050
Functionality improved.

929
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,170
1000% increase in range.

930
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,681
I have found a match...

931
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,849
...on that island.

932
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,448
- Killer view.
- Yeah. If I...

933
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,603
If I wasn't terrified of heights,

934
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,886
I'd probably love this.

935
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,361
But I'm terrified of heights,
so I don't love it.

936
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,089
There. Baymax, take us in.

937
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,681
Awesome!

938
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,121
Our first landing together as a team.

939
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,089
Guys, come on.

940
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,367
"Quarantine"?

941
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,251
Do you people know
what "quarantine" means?

942
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,363
"Quarantine." Enforced isolation

943
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,722
to prevent contamination
that could lead to disease,

944
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,570
or, in some cases, death.

945
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,047
There's a skull face on this one.

946
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,281
A skull face!

947
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,646
Be ready.

948
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,723
He could be anywhere.

949
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,890
Fire!

950
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,249
Spitting fire! Spitting fire!

951
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,244
That was a bird.

952
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,807
Well, at least we know our gear works.

953
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,922
<i>Six intrepid friends</i>

954
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,366
<i>Led by Fred</i>

955
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,204
<i>Their leader, Fred</i>

956
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,681
<i>Fred's Angels</i>

957
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,282
<i>Fred's Angels</i>

958
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,449
<i>Harnessing the power of the sun</i>

959
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,042
<i>With the ancient amulet
They found in the attic</i>

960
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,610
<i>The amulet is green</i>

961
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,125
<i>It's probably an emerald</i>

962
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,488
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face.

963
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,125
Guys.

964
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,045
Any sign of him, Baymax?

965
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,291
This structure is
interfering with my sensor.

966
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,007
Perfect. The robot's broken.

967
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,486
Guys, you might want to see this.

968
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,842
What do you think it is, genius?

969
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,691
I'm not sure. But look.

970
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,481
Hiro.

971
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,091
Krei.

972
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,686
<i>That's right.</i>

973
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,241
<i>We were asked to do the impossible.</i>

974
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,401
<i>That's what we did.</i>

975
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,286
<i>We've reinvented
the very concept of transportation.</i>

976
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,048
<i>Friends, I present
Project Silent Sparrow.</i>

977
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,281
<i>General, may I?</i>

978
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,565
Magic hat!

979
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,891
<i>Teleportation.</i>

980
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,810
<i>The transport of matter
instantaneously through space.</i>

981
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,130
<i>Not science fiction anymore.</i>

982
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,249
<i>Now, we didn't spend billions
of tax dollars</i>

983
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,646
<i>to teleport hats.</i>

984
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,722
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you're here to witness history.</i>

985
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,565
<i>Ready to go for a ride, Abigail?</i>

986
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,443
<i>We've invited all these people.</i>

987
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,250
<i>Might as well give 'em a show.</i>

988
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,131
<i>T-minus 30 seconds to launch.</i>

989
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,404
<i>- 29... 28...
- This is Argo.</i>

990
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,250
<i>- Capsule's in position.
- 27...</i>

991
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,121
<i>Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity
in the magnetic containment field.</i>

992
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:11,090
<i>Mr. Krei, is there a problem?</i>

993
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,651
<i>No. No problem.</i>

994
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,281
<i>It's well within the parameters.</i>

995
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,771
<i>Let's move forward.</i>

996
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,764
<i>3... 2... 1...</i>

997
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,445
<i>Cabin pressure is go.</i>

998
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,489
<i>Pod engaged.</i>

999
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,604
<i>Field breach! Abort!</i>

1000
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,002
<i>We've lost all contact with the pod.</i>

1001
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,367
Oh, no.

1002
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,886
<i>- It's breaking up!
- The pilot is gone.</i>

1003
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,050
<i>Portal two is down.</i>

1004
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,210
<i>The magnetic
containment field's down!</i>

1005
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,483
<i>Krei, shut it down now!</i>

1006
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,170
<i>I want this island sealed off!</i>

1007
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,204
The government shut down
Krei's experiment.

1008
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,165
And he's using your microbots
to steal his machine back.

1009
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,329
Krei is the guy in the mask.

1010
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,211
Oh, no.

1011
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,442
Baymax, get us out of here.

1012
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,841
Go for the transmitter.

1013
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,491
Behind his mask.

1014
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,367
Baymax!

1015
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,521
All right, what's the plan?

1016
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,046
It's Fred time.

1017
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,166
Super Jump!

1018
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,847
Gravity Crush!

1019
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,369
Falling hard.

1020
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,166
Seriously, what is the plan?

1021
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,727
- Get the mask.
- Right behind you.

1022
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,928
For real, what is the plan?

1023
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,367
Hey!

1024
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,841
Hey!

1025
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,724
You want to dance, masked man?

1026
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,610
'Cause you'll be dancing with these.

1027
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,730
Hand over the mask,
or you'll get a taste of this!

1028
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,001
And a little bit of that!

1029
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,409
Hey! I did all right.

1030
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,490
Is that all you got?

1031
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,089
You got that, too?

1032
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,241
It's back into the fire!

1033
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,130
It's over, Krei.

1034
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,208
Pro... Professor Callaghan?

1035
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,649
The explosion...

1036
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:39,961
You died.

1037
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,646
No. I had your microbots.

1038
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,650
But, Tadashi.

1039
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,881
You just let him die.

1040
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,327
Give me the mask, Hiro.

1041
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,005
He went in there to save you!

1042
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,486
That was his mistake!

1043
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,642
Baymax, destroy.

1044
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,090
My programing prevents me
from injuring a human being.

1045
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,526
Not anymore.

1046
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,523
Hiro, this is not what...

1047
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,361
Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!

1048
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,845
No! Stop, Baymax!

1049
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,727
No, stop! He's getting away!

1050
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,569
Baymax!

1051
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,921
My healthcare protocol
has been violated.

1052
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,726
I regret any distress I may have caused.

1053
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,247
How could you do that? I had him!

1054
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,250
What you just did,
we never signed up for.

1055
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,568
We said we'd catch the guy.

1056
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,801
That's it.

1057
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,929
I never should have let you help me!

1058
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,924
Baymax, find Callaghan.

1059
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,048
My enhanced scanner
has been damaged.

1060
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,526
Wings.

1061
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,925
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan.

1062
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,451
Fly!

1063
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,210
Hiro!

1064
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,608
Your blood pressure is elevated.

1065
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,009
You appear to be distressed.

1066
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,730
I'm fine!

1067
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,731
There. Is it working?

1068
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,651
- My sensor is operational.
- Good.

1069
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,491
Then let's get...

1070
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,126
What?

1071
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,482
Are you going to remove
my healthcare chip?

1072
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,330
Yes. Open!

1073
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,365
My purpose is to heal
the sick and injured.

1074
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,522
Baymax, open your access port.

1075
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,328
Do you want me to terminate
Professor Callaghan?

1076
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,483
Just open!

1077
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,368
Will terminating Professor Callaghan
improve your emotional state?

1078
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,728
Yes! No! I don't know!

1079
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,001
Open your access!

1080
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,481
- Is this what Tadashi wanted?
- It doesn't matter!

1081
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,921
Tadashi programed me to aid and...

1082
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,323
Tadashi's gone!

1083
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,201
Tadashi's gone.

1084
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,323
Tadashi is here.

1085
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,883
No. He's not here.

1086
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,926
Tadashi is here.

1087
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,927
<i>This is Tadashi Hamada.</i>

1088
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,761
<i>And this is the first test
of my robotics project.</i>

1089
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,281
<i>Hello, I am Baymax.</i>

1090
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,090
<i>Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!</i>

1091
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,204
<i>The seventh test of my robotics project.</i>

1092
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,606
<i>Hello, I...</i>

1093
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,964
<i>What? What?</i>

1094
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,249
<i>Wait, wait, wait, stop!
Stop scan! Stop...</i>

1095
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,882
<i>Tadashi Hamada again,</i>

1096
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,244
<i>and this is the 33rd test
of my robotics project.</i>

1097
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,923
<i>I'm not giving up on you.</i>

1098
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,731
<i>You don't understand this yet,
but people need you.</i>

1099
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,564
<i>So, let's get back to work.</i>

1100
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,891
<i>This is Tadashi Hamada,</i>

1101
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,489
<i>and this is the 84th test.</i>

1102
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,290
<i>What do you say, big guy?</i>

1103
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,921
<i>Hello, I am Baymax,</i>

1104
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,003
<i>your personal healthcare companion.</i>

1105
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,287
<i>It works.</i>

1106
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,641
<i>It works!</i>

1107
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,331
<i>This is amazing! You... You work!</i>

1108
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,928
<i>I knew it! I knew it! I knew it.</i>

1109
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,243
<i>I knew it. Oh, you work.
I can't believe it! I can't...</i>

1110
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,841
<i>Okay. All right, big moment, here.</i>

1111
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,250
<i>Scan me.</i>

1112
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,131
<i>Your neurotransmitter
levels are elevated.</i>

1113
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,448
<i>This indicates that you are happy.</i>

1114
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,967
<i>I am. I really am.</i>

1115
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,007
<i>Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you.</i>

1116
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,921
<i>You're gonna help
so many people, buddy.</i>

1117
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,690
<i>So many.</i>

1118
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,601
<i>That's all for now.
I am satisfied with my care.</i>

1119
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,642
Thank you, Baymax.

1120
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,689
I'm so sorry.

1121
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,401
I guess I'm not like my brother.

1122
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,411
Hiro.

1123
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,891
Guys, I... I...

1124
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,807
We're going to catch Callaghan,

1125
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,208
and, this time, we'll do it right.

1126
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,089
But maybe don't leave your team
stranded on a spooky island next time.

1127
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,081
- Oh, man.
- Nah, it's cool.

1128
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,322
Heathcliff picked us up
in the family chopper.

1129
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,251
Hiro, we found something
you should see.

1130
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,606
<i>You almost got us all killed!</i>

1131
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,922
<i>Krei! You did this!</i>

1132
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,889
<i>You knew it wasn't ready!</i>

1133
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,842
Callaghan? He was there?

1134
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,084
He was such a good man.
What happened?

1135
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,566
I don't know.

1136
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,529
But the answer's here somewhere.

1137
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,203
Wait, wait! Stop.

1138
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,010
There he is.

1139
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,842
With the pilot.

1140
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,240
Hang on.

1141
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,370
<i>We've invited all these people...</i>

1142
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,563
The pilot was Callaghan's daughter.

1143
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,803
Callaghan blames Krei.

1144
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,407
This is a revenge story.

1145
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,489
So, what are we waiting for?

1146
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,571
It's all set up.

1147
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,208
<i>This beautiful new campus
is the culmination of a lifelong dream.</i>

1148
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,968
<i>But none of this
would've been possible</i>

1149
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,447
<i>without a few bumps in the road.</i>

1150
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,129
<i>Those setbacks made us stronger,
and set us on the path</i>

1151
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,406
<i>to a bright future.</i>

1152
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,966
What is that?

1153
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,450
- What?
- Setback?

1154
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,327
Was my daughter a "setback"?

1155
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,762
Callaghan! But you...

1156
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,841
Your daughter, that...

1157
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,320
That was an accident.

1158
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,444
No! You knew it was unsafe.

1159
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,086
My daughter is gone
because of your arrogance.

1160
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,001
What are you doing?

1161
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:38,285
You took everything from me when
you sent Abigail into that machine.

1162
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,129
Now I'm taking everything from you.

1163
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,401
No!

1164
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,170
No! No! You can't!

1165
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,891
You're going to watch
everything you've built disappear.

1166
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,646
Then, it's your turn.

1167
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,530
Professor Callaghan!

1168
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,161
Let him go!

1169
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,165
Is this what Abigail would've wanted?

1170
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,044
Abigail is gone!

1171
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,364
This won't change anything.
Trust me, I know.

1172
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,250
Listen to the kid, Callaghan.

1173
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,481
Please, let me go.

1174
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,682
I'll give you anything you want!

1175
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,243
I want my daughter back!

1176
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,161
Go for the mask!

1177
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,401
Baymax!

1178
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,085
Leaping into action!

1179
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,565
Oh, no!

1180
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,404
Getting a little tight.

1181
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,602
<i>- No!
- He's too strong!</i>

1182
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,962
<i>- There's no way out!
- You can't beat him!</i>

1183
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,440
<i>Help! I can't beat him.</i>

1184
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,926
<i>Hiro!</i>

1185
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,287
<i>- Hiro? Hiro?
- Help!</i>

1186
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,007
- That's it!
<i>- Hiro.</i>

1187
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,446
- I know how to beat him.
<i>- Hiro.</i>

1188
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,487
Listen up!

1189
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,926
<i>Use those big brains of yours</i>

1190
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,451
<i>and think your way
around the problem.</i>

1191
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,010
<i>Look for a new angle.</i>

1192
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,126
My arms! They can't go any further!

1193
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,609
Wait a second, it's a suit.

1194
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,451
Hello, sign.

1195
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,961
Care to go for a little spin?

1196
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,645
Double spin!

1197
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,801
Behind-the-back spin!

1198
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,126
Yeah!

1199
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,681
Yeah!

1200
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,641
Baymax!

1201
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,650
Hiro.

1202
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,965
I love that robot!

1203
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,003
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask.

1204
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,402
Take out the bots.
They'll get sucked up into the portal.

1205
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,040
Now that is a plan!

1206
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,288
Honey, Fred,
can you give us some cover?

1207
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,250
Like you have to ask.

1208
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,527
Let's do this, Freddie!

1209
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,440
Smokescreen!

1210
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,040
Ready and

1211
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,086
dive!

1212
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,041
Whoa, the gravity's getting
a little weird here, guys!

1213
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,247
Wait.

1214
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,601
Let's use this!

1215
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,726
These are green blades of fury!

1216
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,645
Woman up!

1217
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,730
Double sign-spin.

1218
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,128
Now my signs are on fire!

1219
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,447
Now that's a chemical reaction!

1220
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,087
Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse.

1221
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,611
Hammerfist.

1222
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,291
This ends now!

1223
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:01,924
Looks like you're out of microbots.

1224
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,161
What?

1225
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,286
Baymax!

1226
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,127
No!

1227
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,041
Our programing prevents us
from injuring a human being.

1228
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,647
But we'll take that.

1229
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,366
It's still on! We have to shut it down!

1230
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,841
We can't!
The containment field is failing.

1231
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,242
The portal is gonna tear itself apart!

1232
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,164
We need to get out of here, now!

1233
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,801
Baymax!

1234
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,167
My sensor is detecting signs of life.

1235
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,244
- What?
- Coming from there.

1236
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,209
The life signs are female.

1237
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,562
She appears to be in hyper-sleep.

1238
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,884
Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive.

1239
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,446
Abigail.

1240
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,286
Let's go get her.

1241
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,205
The portal is destabilizing.
You'll never make it.

1242
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,370
She's alive in there.

1243
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,210
Someone has to help.

1244
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,128
What do you say, buddy?

1245
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,011
Flying makes me
a better healthcare companion.

1246
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,761
Careful! There's Krei
Tech debris everywhere.

1247
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,971
Look out!

1248
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,290
I have located the patient.

1249
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,520
Hurry!

1250
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,804
Come on, buddy, let's get her home.

1251
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,367
I'll guide you out of here. Let's go!

1252
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,931
Veer right!

1253
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,842
Okay, to the left.

1254
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,051
Hard right!

1255
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,520
Up and over.

1256
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,161
Okay, level off. Easy.

1257
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,282
Nice flying!

1258
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,210
Almost there!

1259
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,441
Baymax!

1260
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,041
Baymax!

1261
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,204
My thrusters are inoperable.

1262
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,281
Just grab hold.

1263
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,243
There is still a way
I can get you both to safety.

1264
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,289
I cannot deactivate until you say
you are satisfied with your care.

1265
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,807
No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you?

1266
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,730
- You are my patient.
- Baymax.

1267
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,245
Your health is my only concern.

1268
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,045
Stop! I'm gonna figure out...

1269
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,765
Are you satisfied with your care?

1270
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,723
No. There's gotta be another way.

1271
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,810
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I'll think of something.

1272
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,411
There is no time.

1273
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,284
Are you satisfied with your care?

1274
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,966
Please! No...

1275
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,164
I can't lose you, too.

1276
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,526
Hiro,

1277
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,601
I will always be with you.

1278
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,762
I'm satisfied with my care.

1279
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,806
Hiro!

1280
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,968
Yeah! They made it!

1281
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,886
Baymax?

1282
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,330
Miss, can you hear me?
What is your name?

1283
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,410
Abigail Callaghan.

1284
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,206
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine.

1285
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,651
We're taking you to the hospital.

1286
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,881
Move it!

1287
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,401
Get in there.

1288
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,049
<i>A massive cleanup continues today</i>

1289
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,168
<i>at the headquarters
of Krei Tech Industries.</i>

1290
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,682
<i>Reports are still flooding in about
a group of unidentified individuals,</i>

1291
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,969
<i>who prevented what could have been
a major catastrophe.</i>

1292
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,726
<i>The whole city
of San Fransokyo is asking,</i>

1293
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,201
<i>"Who are these heroes?
And where are they now?"</i>

1294
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,691
- Hey.
- Hi.

1295
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:20,926
It's so exciting.

1296
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,326
Hey, sweetie!

1297
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,607
Okay.

1298
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,166
Last hug.

1299
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,561
Bye!

1300
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,243
- And just then I was like...
- Get out of here.

1301
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,281
Ow?

1302
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,571
I am Baymax,
your personal healthcare companion.

1303
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,366
Hello, Hiro.

1304
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,521
<i>We didn't set out to be superheroes,</i>

1305
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,963
<i>but sometimes life doesn't go
the way you planned.</i>

1306
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,126
<i>The good thing is, my brother
wanted to help a lot of people,</i>

1307
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,844
<i>and that's what we're gonna do.</i>

1308
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,560
<i>Who are we?</i>

1309
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,324
Dad, I just wish I could share
my accomplishments with you.

1310
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,329
You mean so much to me, and honestly,

1311
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,801
I've always felt a distance

1312
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:33,249
what with you being
on the family island all the time,

1313
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,610
and I just wish you could see how...

1314
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,001
Fred.

1315
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,841
Son.

1316
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,806
Dad?

1317
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:08,201
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back.

1318
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,487
I go inside out, then I go front and back.

1319
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,886
Dad!

1320
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,169
We have a lot to talk about.
