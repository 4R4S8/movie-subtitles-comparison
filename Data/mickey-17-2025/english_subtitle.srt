1
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:08,281
{\an8} <i>How did I survive that?</i>

2
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:13,202
<i>It was some damn fall.</i>

3
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:17,289
<i>Oh, shit. My comm's busted.</i>

4
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,709
<i>My thermal's busted too.</i>

5
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:24,839
<i>I should have got snapped in half
and died on the way down,</i>

6
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:28,217
<i>instead of slowly turning
into a meat popsicle.</i>

7
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:31,262
Timo?

8
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:34,432
Timo!

9
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:38,353
Timo, I'm down here.

10
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:41,898
Ow.

11
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,775
Timo.

12
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:49,572
Mickey?

13
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:51,115
T... Timo!

14
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:55,078
- Timo, I'm down here.
- Mickey. Whoa.

15
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,956
You haven't died yet?

16
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,873
- No.
- Hold on.

17
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:11,469
Oh, shit.

18
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:14,389
Your flamethrower's still good.

19
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,391
Not a single scratch.

20
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,393
It's a good thing I thought
to come down here.

21
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:21,311
Weapons will be happy to see this.

22
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,896
Hey, I'm gonna turn this in, okay?

23
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,524
I can take it.

24
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:28,486
You're not mad, right?
That I'm just taking this?

25
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:33,157
I mean, it's not looking very good
for you, right?

26
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:37,495
- Also, line only goes this far.
- Uh-huh.

27
00:02:38,663 --> 00:02:41,666
Yeah, no, we... we're cool.

28
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:45,628
You shouldn't have to take the risk.

29
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:48,673
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

30
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:54,762
Plus, they're gonna reprint you
back out tomorrow anyway.

31
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:57,557
Yeah.

32
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:02,312
Hey, Mickey.

33
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:04,022
Yeah?

34
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,066
What's it feel like to die?

35
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:15,783
I'm sure you're used to it by now.
Still...

36
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,917
How many times is this?

37
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,836
You're Mickey... 16?

38
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:31,090
17. Jerk.

39
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:33,675
18 after this one.

40
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:37,179
Well, it was nice knowing you,
have a nice death.

41
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,515
See you tomorrow.

42
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:43,269
<i>Oh, great.</i>

43
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,773
<i>Why not?</i>

44
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:53,696
<i>That's a pretty big one.</i>

45
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:57,658
<i>Hopefully, I'll just get swallowed
in one go.</i>

46
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,036
<i>It's got to be better
than slowly freezing to death.</i>

47
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:02,496
<i>I guess.</i>

48
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,598
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

49
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,074
<i>But they just
printed me out again</i>

50
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:40,784
<i>every time I died.</i>

51
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:44,622
<i>All my data is saved,
and I just get a whole new body.</i>

52
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:49,168
<i>They do all this, kind of,
regular uploads of memories</i>

53
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,420
<i>and my personality traits...</i>

54
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:55,675
<i>and re-implant it back in my brain.</i>

55
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,968
<i>That's some crazy technology, man.</i>

56
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:01,180
<i>Let's just say it's... it's advanced.</i>

57
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,016
<i>It's very advanced.</i>

58
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,980
Yes.

59
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:11,607
Oh, come on, come on.

60
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:14,109
Wait. Would you just hold on a second?

61
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,028
Just like... Calm down. Calm down.

62
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,113
Just relax, breathe.
That's right, breathe.

63
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:19,574
- Oh!
- Yes!

64
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,536
<i>The whole body printing
and memory transplanting thing,</i>

65
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:28,081
<i>to be honest, was so ridiculously
ahead of its time,</i>

66
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:31,960
<i>that it caused so many, like,
ethical fights</i>

67
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,837
<i>and religious blah, blah, blah,</i>

68
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:36,800
<i>that it was actually banned on Earth,</i>

69
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:41,094
<i>and they only allow it now
in outer space for Expendables.</i>

70
00:05:41,095 --> 00:05:42,638
<i>Like me.</i>

71
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,598
<i>So, from the second
we left the atmosphere,</i>

72
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,060
<i>they made me work my ass off
all the way to this planet.</i>

73
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:50,396
<i>Gave me one mission after another.</i>

74
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:56,361
Uh, Tech, what's going on?
The extra cable's here already.

75
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,905
<i>Um, the thing is, Mickey...</i>

76
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:01,991
<i>Hey, Medical, you wanna tell him?</i>

77
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,701
Tell me what?

78
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:06,495
<i>Hi, Mickey. How're you doing?</i>

79
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,499
<i>Are you experiencing any vertigo,
nausea or dizziness?</i>

80
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:14,002
Uh, I-I guess I am feeling
a little dizzy.

81
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:16,589
<i>It's only gonna get worse
from here, Mickey,</i>

82
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:18,507
<i>with a nice fever too.</i>

83
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:22,094
<i>Truth is, you're exposed to unthinkable
levels of radiation right now,</i>

84
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:25,013
<i>which is why we sent you out
in the first place.</i>

85
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:26,265
Okay.

86
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,559
<i>If you could give us
a full description of your symptoms.</i>

87
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,311
<i>So, a couple things I wanna go through</i>

88
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,772
<i>on our cosmic radiation checklist first.</i>

89
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,942
<i>How long until your skin starts to burn?</i>

90
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:39,987
<i>Then, how long until you go blind?</i>

91
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:42,406
<i>And of course, how long until you die?</i>

92
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:45,785
<i>That's the real nut we're after.</i>

93
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,957
<i>There was this one time
in my fourth grade science class,</i>

94
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,294
<i>I messed with a lab frog.</i>

95
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:58,131
<i>I just figured
this all must be my punishment.</i>

96
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:01,633
<i>Mickey, take off your glove,</i>

97
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:04,345
<i>so I can see what's happening
under your space suit.</i>

98
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:18,901
<i>Oh! Oh! Wow! Did you see that?</i>

99
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:49,097
Good morning.

100
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:50,974
Keep yourself hydrated, Mickey.

101
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:53,060
You'll start to feel extremely parched.

102
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,437
Arkady, I think the dose was too high.

103
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:57,981
Who cares, Dorothy?
He's gonna be dead in ten minutes.

104
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,733
Just focus on getting
all the blood samples.

105
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:02,445
He's gonna bleed through his eyes,
nose, mouth, ears, and rectum.

106
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:07,032
Make sure to collect separate samples
from every hole. Okay?

107
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,952
And keep the memory upload going
at the same time.

108
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,081
This Mickey's special,
you know that, right?

109
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:17,252
Out of all the Mickeys,
you will have the shortest lifespan.

110
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:21,756
- I heard. Ten minutes.
- Well...

111
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:26,385
Actually, good news, it's more like 15.

112
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:29,304
Much better, isn't it?

113
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:31,181
<i>I would have been
filthy rich by now</i>

114
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,432
<i>with life insurance, except...</i>

115
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:36,395
<i>obviously,
Expendables are uninsurable.</i>

116
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:40,859
<i>There's no workers' comp,
no unions, no pension benefits.</i>

117
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:44,611
<i>Now, I wouldn't be surprised
if you were thinking at this point,</i>

118
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:47,657
<i>"Well then, why... why did you
do this to yourself?"</i>

119
00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:51,577
<i>Well, because I had a friend who told me</i>

120
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:56,166
<i>that one day macarons
would sell better than burgers.</i>

121
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:02,504
{\an8}<i>And because I trusted this shitty friend,
and I got an enormous loan</i>

122
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:07,260
{\an8}<i>from a wonderful gentleman
to open a macaron store.</i>

123
00:09:18,396 --> 00:09:21,857
Oh, shit.

124
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,127
All right, all right,

125
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,463
calm down.

126
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:46,049
I'm well aware
that you have four weeks left.

127
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:48,343
Just think of this as a little field trip.

128
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,302
A taste of what may unfold

129
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,805
should you fail to reimburse us
in a timely manner.

130
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:56,099
{\an8}Besides, you two have
a lot of time on your hands,

131
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,603
{\an8}with your little macaron shop gone under.

132
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:02,564
This is quite a show
you got on here for me, quite a show.

133
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:04,942
The message is clear, I hear you.
I hear it loud and clear,

134
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:06,360
"I'm late. I'm late. The money is late."

135
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,778
It's coming. Two people behind...

136
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,865
<i>Darius Blank.
A name I wish I'd never heard.</i>

137
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:15,702
{\an8}Mr. Blank isn't all that concerned
with money.

138
00:10:15,703 --> 00:10:17,412
He has plenty.

139
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,749
This building's just one
of his many assets.

140
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,918
Watching his delinquent borrowers die,

141
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,087
savoring the details of death...

142
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:27,298
that, he truly enjoys.

143
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:29,633
The message is clear. You can stop now.
We can stop, you know?

144
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:31,426
It's... It's... I hear you.

145
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:33,846
You know, two weeks,
two weeks is all it takes.

146
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:36,140
All it takes now.
A-A-And more is coming,

147
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:37,474
there's more coming, more money is...

148
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:39,685
{\an8}More money is, is, is...

149
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:52,197
We caught that gentleman four days ago
in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

150
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:53,575
Looks expensive.

151
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:58,245
Rest assured,
anyone who misses the deadline,

152
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:00,498
we chase them to the ends of the Earth.

153
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,626
<i>So we decided
to get off of Earth.</i>

154
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:10,175
<i>Nothing was working out,
and I got no family relying on me.</i>

155
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,426
<i>So, I applied to the colony expedition,</i>

156
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:15,429
<i>but there's, like, a million other people
with the same idea.</i>

157
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,264
<i>Seems like the whole of this rotten planet</i>

158
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:18,682
<i>was running away from something.</i>

159
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:21,351
<i>I guess everybody's got money problems.</i>

160
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:23,854
<i>But anyway, we had to get on this ship,</i>

161
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,856
<i>because it was the last one of the season.</i>

162
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,693
Waves upon waves of people
desperate to leave Earth.

163
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:33,071
It's clear anti-migrationists
are talking to a brick wall

164
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,407
when they insist on fixing up the Earth,

165
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:39,828
instead of risking lives
by migrating to another planet.

166
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:42,581
It feels like these passionate applicants

167
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:44,666
are already off in space.

168
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,919
More importantly, this is the expedition

169
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,131
led by former congressman,
Kenneth Marshall,

170
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:53,091
who lost his last two elections.

171
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,802
Is this failed politician

172
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:58,472
now trying to establish
a kingdom beyond the stars?

173
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:00,974
Is it his fanatical supporters

174
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:02,893
who won him a generous sponsorship

175
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:06,605
from a particular religious
organization and corporation?

176
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,024
So many questions left unanswered.

177
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,776
Let's go and talk to the crowd.

178
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:13,862
Excuse me, are you
a Kenneth Marshall supporter?

179
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,781
I am. I am, big time.

180
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:17,491
I am a full-on supporter.

181
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:19,535
I basically am the one and only.

182
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:21,537
Are you from
M-Marshall's official channel?

183
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,372
- I'm from EC 20...
- No way.

184
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:25,249
So Marshall's watching this right now?

185
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,708
- Oh, my God!
- You need to pick me.

186
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,920
I swear, please pick me.

187
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:32,090
You need people young
and healthy for the expedition.

188
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:35,634
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have another mild sandstorm today.</i>

189
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:38,178
<i>Access is now restricted to gate three.</i>

190
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,181
<i>Please visit our stand
for discounted goggles and masks.</i>

191
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:44,768
<i>Additional five percent off
with Marshall Pay, as always.</i>

192
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,353
The other expeditions wouldn't take me,

193
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:48,396
but they're wrong, I promise.

194
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:51,983
I can fix toilets. I make gingerbread.
You gotta take me, give me a shot.

195
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,360
Take us to the clean star,
Marshall and Ylfa.

196
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:55,987
Take me with you!

197
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:03,745
Expendable.

198
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:06,415
You're applying to be an Expendable?

199
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,250
Seriously?

200
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,753
You read through the whole application?

201
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,214
Yeah.

202
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:17,134
<i>I should have read through it.</i>

203
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,760
<i>I mean, I didn't have
too much of a choice.</i>

204
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:23,182
<i>I don't have any bona fide certifications.</i>

205
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,518
<i>I don't really have any skills whatsoever.</i>

206
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,272
<i>Then I find out Timo's already called dibs</i>

207
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:34,651
<i>on a position for himself,
as a flitter pilot.</i>

208
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:37,654
<i>He only just got his learner's
permit a couple of weeks before.</i>

209
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:42,241
<i>No idea what he had to come up with
to pull that off,</i>

210
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:43,827
<i>but you gotta give it to him.</i>

211
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:47,830
Excuse me.

212
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:51,250
Is there, like, some construction
going on?

213
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,627
Sorry, what?

214
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:54,546
You don't hear like a...

215
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:58,050
like a ch-chain saw?

216
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:01,011
Uh, no.

217
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,971
<i>I wanted to get
the hell outta there.</i>

218
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:06,892
<i>Somewhere where the sound
couldn't follow me.</i>

219
00:14:07,684 --> 00:14:09,353
<i>Far out into space.</i>

220
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,148
You read through the paperwork?

221
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:14,690
Yes.

222
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,526
You read it, so you know, right?

223
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:19,070
This is gonna be a pretty extreme job.

224
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:21,490
But it's also gonna be fun.

225
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,116
I'll explain all the details.

226
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:27,453
<i>I got so distracted
by that smell, uh,</i>

227
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:30,081
<i>the smell of this woman's hair.</i>

228
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:34,127
<i>It was like it brought back
some far away memory, or something.</i>

229
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:37,840
That giant tank downstairs
is called a cycler.

230
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:41,384
It takes organic waste produced
in the spaceship,

231
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:44,387
apple peels, chicken bones, rotten eggs,

232
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:47,056
dead bodies, human waste, you name it...

233
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:50,560
then it combines, refines,
and recycles them

234
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:54,647
and sends a portion to this printer.

235
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:57,025
Raw materials for a human body.

236
00:14:57,818 --> 00:14:59,610
Once you die, and the Committee approves,

237
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:02,823
it'll print a new version of your body
within 20 hours.

238
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:07,286
Take your clothes off, change into this.

239
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:10,955
<i>I couldn't even hear
anything she was saying.</i>

240
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:15,294
<i>It was like all of my senses
were focused on my nose.</i>

241
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:20,591
<i>Like, real déjà vu, but for a smell.</i>

242
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:24,844
We're going to do a full scan
of your biodata.

243
00:15:24,845 --> 00:15:28,015
That means you'll be reprinted
exactly as you are right now.

244
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,892
Forever.

245
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:33,311
I better pop this.

246
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:35,397
Otherwise, it will be there every time.

247
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,651
<i>Well, I'm glad she didn't know</i>

248
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:42,029
<i>about the one on my butt.</i>

249
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,993
<i>So, after she does the body scan,</i>

250
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:50,953
<i>she uploaded my memories.</i>

251
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:53,873
<i>Called it a "personality backup."</i>

252
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,416
<i>And I gotta do this once a week,</i>

253
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,378
<i>so I don't have any big gaps
every time they print me out.</i>

254
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,672
In the past,
you would have needed

255
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,382
a hard drive the size of
a commercial refrigerator

256
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:04,967
to copy an adult brain.

257
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:07,930
Now, this little brick.
Clever, right?

258
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:11,182
<i>So, I was injected with some</i>

259
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,934
<i>special solution.</i>

260
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:15,771
<i>It brought back a flood of old memories.</i>

261
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:18,857
<i>Too many memories.</i>

262
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,988
<i>We were heading home
from the supermarket.</i>

263
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:27,533
<i>I asked to sit in the front seat.</i>

264
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,867
<i>I said, "I'm big enough."</i>

265
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:32,329
<i>And that's when I saw the red button.</i>

266
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:35,123
<i>I just pressed it and she crashed.</i>

267
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:11,159
Put it to your head and pull the trigger.

268
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:14,453
This is the final requirement
to become an Expendable.

269
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:17,832
Prove to me you have faith in the system.

270
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:22,004
From now on,
you need to get used to dying.

271
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:24,005
This is your job.

272
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:49,530
<i>I began
the four-and-a-half year journey</i>

273
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:50,824
<i>as Mickey 1.</i>

274
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,080
<i>When you're stuck in a spaceship
for that long,</i>

275
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,875
<i>food is everything.</i>

276
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,127
<i>Warning, Mickey 1.</i>

277
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:06,507
<i>Seven calories over
the current ration allocation.</i>

278
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,229
<i>On that first day
in the cafeteria,</i>

279
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,524
<i>I think I might have started thinking,</i>

280
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,859
<i>"What have I done?" a little.</i>

281
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,987
<i>The whole room was full of people
eating this crappy food,</i>

282
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:33,783
<i>and there's total silence, like,
you could hear a pin drop.</i>

283
00:18:33,784 --> 00:18:39,455
<i>Until, Kenneth Marshall
and his wife, Ylfa, walk in.</i>

284
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:44,377
<i>And a whole bunch of people
just started going nuts.</i>

285
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:58,391
<i>I was thinking,
"What the hell am I doing here?"</i>

286
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,482
<i>But that's when I saw her.</i>

287
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,026
<i>Nasha.</i>

288
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:13,240
<i>That was the first time
I saw Nasha Barridge.</i>

289
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,746
<i>On day one in this long journey.</i>

290
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:15,260
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!

291
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,515
All right, enough. Enough.

292
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:24,560
Keep that up for one minute
and you waste five calories.

293
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:28,482
That's two percent of the precious meal
you're eating right now.

294
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:31,108
<i>As you know, our number one priority</i>

295
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:35,196
<i>is to conserve food resources
until our arrival at Niflheim,</i>

296
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:37,782
<i>so that we maximize our survival rate.</i>

297
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:39,368
So, listen up.

298
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,370
Sexual intercourse, for example.

299
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,579
- Each...
- Session.

300
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,208
Session consumes
a whopping 100 calories.

301
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:49,085
- At least.
- At least.

302
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,463
Depending on the participants,

303
00:20:51,588 --> 00:20:54,091
duration times friction equals...

304
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:56,551
The point is, Kenneth is talking
to the Committee

305
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:59,428
about banning all sexual activity
on the ship.

306
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:00,596
What?

307
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:01,932
Well, I don't have a problem with that.

308
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:11,566
Darling, are you sure this is
the right time to bring that up?

309
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:14,236
Honey, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

310
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:18,865
No. It's okay.

311
00:21:18,866 --> 00:21:21,701
Am I doing okay?
Should I go harder?

312
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:24,287
- Yes! Yes, go hard.
- All right.

313
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:28,249
Fellow pioneers,

314
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,418
once we've arrived in Niflheim

315
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,753
and we've secured our food production,

316
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,631
we will launch the greatest

317
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:38,259
sex encouragement campaign in history.

318
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:48,269
You will spread your seed
across the planet.

319
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,276
First we survive! Then we thrive!

320
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:57,738
Then we go forth and multiply!

321
00:21:58,113 --> 00:21:59,864
Propagate the species!

322
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:02,366
We shall infest the land!

323
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:06,246
Marshall! Marshall! Marshall!

324
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,332
<i>And so we started infesting.</i>

325
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,918
<i>With love.</i>

326
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:21,636
And then, unfortunately, this is...

327
00:22:21,637 --> 00:22:23,095
Yeah. And now do this bit.

328
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:24,847
Ooh.

329
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:27,391
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, it's not that big.

330
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:32,523
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:37,693
<i>Those four years
would have felt like 40</i>

332
00:22:37,694 --> 00:22:40,029
<i>if it weren't for Nasha.</i>

333
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,114
<i>She stayed with me in the best of times...</i>

334
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:47,079
<i>and kept by my side
in the worst of times.</i>

335
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:57,131
<i>Not everyone gets lucky enough</i>

336
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:58,714
<i>to find a soulmate like this.</i>

337
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,133
<i>None of this would have happened</i>

338
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:02,051
<i>if I'd never boarded this spaceship,</i>

339
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:05,179
<i>so all hail the great
loan shark, Darius Blank.</i>

340
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,431
<i>Thanks, Darius.</i>

341
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:08,933
<i>But it wasn't like I was slacking, though.</i>

342
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:12,145
<i>I was super busy every day,
taking care of Nasha,</i>

343
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:15,107
<i>and she's an all-in-one elite agent.</i>

344
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,942
<i>And it's not easy supporting someone</i>

345
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:21,779
<i>who's a soldier, a police officer,
and a firefighter.</i>

346
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,074
<i>But what she sees in me,
I got no idea.</i>

347
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:26,702
<i>I'm just grateful.</i>

348
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:29,412
<i>But as soon as I step out the door,</i>

349
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:32,582
<i>the ship was filled with mostly...
dickheads.</i>

350
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,126
Hey! Mickey, right?

351
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:37,963
Can we just ask...

352
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:42,634
Well... what's it like to die?

353
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:46,262
You know, when you're reprinted?

354
00:23:46,263 --> 00:23:47,848
Yeah, how does that feel?

355
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:51,434
Come on, just tell us.
We really want to know.

356
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,060
<i>Imagine spending years,</i>

357
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:54,312
<i>elbow-to-elbow with these bozos.</i>

358
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:55,438
He won't tell us.

359
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,731
<i>It was enough to push anyone
over the edge.</i>

360
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:58,774
- "You'd have to kill me first!"
- "Over my dead body!"

361
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:00,234
<i>Sometimes even Nasha,</i>

362
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,069
<i>- who is a model citizen...</i>
- Over your dead body?

363
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,113
<i>Would have to step in and remind us...</i>

364
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:05,573
Over your dead body?

365
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:06,949
<i>That we were
all one big happy family.</i>

366
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,117
Where do you think you're going?

367
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:09,368
<i>There to help one another.</i>

368
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:11,329
<i>There to have each other's backs.</i>

369
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,331
<i>A tight-knit harmonious community.</i>

370
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,333
What do you say?

371
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,834
<i>And the Committee has reduced</i>

372
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:18,669
<i>Mickey 9's rations by half</i>

373
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,006
<i>and assigned him
to manual cycler cleaning</i>

374
00:24:21,131 --> 00:24:22,966
<i>until further notice.</i>

375
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:25,052
Congrats, man!

376
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,929
Hey, Mickey.

377
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:29,807
You must be hungry.
Have some more.

378
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:33,435
Uh, thanks, Kai. Um...

379
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:37,063
Do you change your shampoo?

380
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:38,356
Shampoo?

381
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:40,525
There's only one shampoo
in this entire spaceship.

382
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,069
- Thank you.
- Okay.

383
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:45,029
<i>It was a very long trip</i>

384
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,990
<i>- in a beautiful community.</i>
- Hi.

385
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:54,373
<i>But, uh, Nasha was obviously
my one and only, you know.</i>

386
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:56,959
<i>For real.</i>

387
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:04,508
<i>And as for my one and only job,
I was proud of it.</i>

388
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:08,220
<i>Felt like I was part of the team.</i>

389
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,974
Matthew! Matthew!

390
00:25:13,142 --> 00:25:16,103
- I'm on the last level!
- Come on, hurry up!

391
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:18,981
Quickly!

392
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,192
<i>My brother travelers...</i>

393
00:25:23,193 --> 00:25:25,362
<i>- And sisters.
- And sisters.</i>

394
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,364
It is long that we have come,

395
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:29,949
four years together in this ship.

396
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,202
And I, we, love you
like our very own family.

397
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:36,163
And here we are,

398
00:25:36,164 --> 00:25:41,918
right below us awaits
our very own planet of purity.

399
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:47,925
What the fuck is wrong with him?
He's so annoying.

400
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:51,095
Maybe he has the flu or something?

401
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:55,056
Like a virgin vanilla ice cream.

402
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:57,852
<i>Touched for the very first time.</i>

403
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:00,979
It's gonna be really cold.

404
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,816
Whoever's going down there first
is gonna freeze to death.

405
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:09,112
<i>That's it, Mickey.
Deep breaths. Fill your lungs.</i>

406
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:11,698
<i>Imagine there's
an unknown virus in the air</i>

407
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:12,699
and you're sucking in

408
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,327
every single microscopic
particle floating around.

409
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:20,707
All the viruses fill every alveoli.

410
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:25,129
So good!

411
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:28,841
So good! Brilliant.

412
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:32,053
<i>There really was
an unknown virus in the air.</i>

413
00:26:33,012 --> 00:26:34,430
<i>A lethal one.</i>

414
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:28,609
Dorothy! Dorothy!

415
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:36,409
Oh, wait. He's alive.

416
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:38,619
So fucking what?

417
00:27:38,828 --> 00:27:40,246
I'm fine.

418
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:44,750
Thank you.

419
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:49,422
<i>In the end,
thanks to the lab rats,</i>

420
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:53,383
<i>Mickey 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16,</i>

421
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:57,138
<i>getting stabbed, gassed, dumped
and burned, we got the vaccine.</i>

422
00:27:57,513 --> 00:27:59,557
<i>My great gift to mankind.</i>

423
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:03,268
<i>And so, we didn't need oxygen masks,</i>

424
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:05,563
<i>and we could see our breath
as much as we wanted.</i>

425
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:09,274
Look at that, Jennifer. Ridiculous.

426
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,193
I can't believe we still live
in that thing.

427
00:28:11,194 --> 00:28:12,444
I know, right?

428
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:14,488
Landfall was ages ago,
and we're still eating

429
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,282
the same crappy in-flight TV dinner.

430
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:22,454
Precisely why we ought
to build residential complexes.

431
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:24,331
You know, grow crops as soon as possible.

432
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:26,082
- Yeah, sure.
- You know, spread the seed,

433
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,960
infest the land, propagate the species.

434
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,424
It's freezing.

435
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:52,901
Whoa. Look at that color.

436
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:54,402
- Yeah.
- It's beautiful...

437
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:02,202
He's such a klutz.
You should learn some breakfall moves.

438
00:29:02,203 --> 00:29:04,079
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

439
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,498
Come on.

440
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:10,168
What's breakfall?

441
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,672
Look at Kai.
Textbook perfect breakfall.

442
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:14,298
- Yeah?
- Shut up.

443
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:25,935
Kai. What is it?

444
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,690
Oh, God! What is that?

445
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:34,776
Oh, my God!

446
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:35,819
Get it off! Get it off!

447
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,071
Mickey!

448
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,492
What the fuck, man?
What the fuck? What the fuck?

449
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:44,536
What was that?
What the heck was that?

450
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:46,454
I don't know,
but there are more in the hole.

451
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,375
- What...
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

452
00:29:50,376 --> 00:29:51,627
Come on, Mickey, let's go!

453
00:29:52,462 --> 00:29:54,839
Go, go, go. Move! Move!

454
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:04,806
Jennifer!

455
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:09,353
Thank you.

456
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:13,399
Mickey. Mickey, it's Marshall.

457
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,777
<i>You fucking useless little asshole!</i>

458
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,196
<i>You're an Expendable!</i>

459
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:21,657
<i>You're here to be expended, damn it!</i>

460
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:25,368
<i>And why is Jennifer Chilton,
a precious, fertile female,</i>

461
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:27,162
<i>- dead and not you?</i>
- Come to my room.

462
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:28,872
- <i>Honey, try this.</i>
- Leave me alone.

463
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,251
<i>That's what I want to know. Disgusting.</i>

464
00:30:33,252 --> 00:30:35,087
<i>Really? You don't like my sauce?</i>

465
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,422
<i>No, no, no, no, darling.</i>

466
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:39,591
<i>- Those things, look at them.</i>
- The fuck's going on?

467
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:41,927
<i>They're vicious, aren't they?</i>

468
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:43,595
<i>Hungry's more like it.</i>

469
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,932
<i>Hey, you! Stand still. Don't move.</i>

470
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:51,229
<i>They lust for human flesh.</i>

471
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:56,233
<i>They're creepy.</i>

472
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:58,026
<i>Oh, honey, that's perfect.</i>

473
00:30:58,027 --> 00:30:59,152
<i>You should call them "creepers".</i>

474
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:02,489
<i>I'll call them "creepers".
I'm calling them "creepers".</i>

475
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,407
<i>Preston, are you listening?</i>

476
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:06,868
<i>Expendable, I've decided,
and the Committee,</i>

477
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:11,040
<i>that going forward,
your rations will be halved.</i>

478
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:13,333
<i>So, my shift doubled.</i>

479
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:17,130
<i>Fourteen hours every day,
seven days a week,</i>

480
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:20,882
<i>until I brought home
a creeper sample.</i>

481
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:23,051
Timo! Timo!

482
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:51,288
<i>Mickey, sexy chewy, your favorite.</i>

483
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:54,000
<i>Chose it myself. Enjoy!</i>

484
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,897
<i>How did I survive that?</i>

485
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:27,617
Mickey! Whoa.

486
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:29,535
You haven't died yet?

487
00:32:33,956 --> 00:32:35,665
What's it feel like to die?

488
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,714
<i>Even on my 17th
go-around, I really hate dying.</i>

489
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:46,135
<i>Still.</i>

490
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,054
<i>Always.</i>

491
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:50,681
<i>Every time.</i>

492
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,475
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

493
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:07,280
<i>Where am I? What's going on?</i>

494
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:09,909
<i>I'm not coming out
of the printer?</i>

495
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:15,706
<i>I'm still 17.</i>

496
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:20,669
<i>Why didn't that thing eat me?
I was passed out.</i>

497
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,715
<i>Did I not look tasty enough?</i>

498
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:33,598
<i>Oh, God. It...</i>

499
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,269
<i>It was saving me for the kiddos.</i>

500
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:40,982
<i>What a great mom.</i>

501
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:45,193
<i>Oh, please just make it quick.</i>

502
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:48,114
<i>Come on guys, big bites.
Big bites!</i>

503
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:51,324
<i>Ow.</i>

504
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:54,078
<i>Where are you taking me now?</i>

505
00:33:56,122 --> 00:33:58,875
<i>Has my meat gone bad
after all that reprinting?</i>

506
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:23,065
Oh!

507
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:30,613
Hey.

508
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:34,326
I'm still good meat.

509
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,580
I'm perfectly good meat.

510
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:40,040
I taste fine.

511
00:34:59,185 --> 00:35:01,938
Ditching me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

512
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:06,274
It's not cool!

513
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:21,249
Hey! Hey!

514
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:22,959
Stop!

515
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:26,087
Hey!

516
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:33,886
Hey. Hey!

517
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:52,904
- Whoa!
- Keep it coming!

518
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:55,115
- Hey wait! Stop!
- Bring it in!

519
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:56,867
No, stop!
You can't come through.

520
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,451
- What?
- I said stop.

521
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:00,954
- What's wrong?
- What is it now? Shit!

522
00:36:00,955 --> 00:36:04,166
Hey, look how big that rock is.
Are you blind?

523
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:06,376
You can't just have the authority
to bring something like that in.

524
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,922
You think you can jam something
that huge through here?

525
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:13,008
Science requested it,
so don't give me shit about it.

526
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:15,260
You try to jam it in,
and scratch anywhere

527
00:36:15,261 --> 00:36:17,679
on this gate, my gate, it's on you.

528
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,515
On me? How?
Blame the guys in Science.

529
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:21,892
They cut into the site,

530
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,685
but I got specific orders
to bring it as is.

531
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:25,854
Well, I don't fucking care, okay?

532
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:28,064
They're in a meeting over there,
I can't reach them.

533
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:29,691
I'm not taking the fall for this.

534
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:30,984
Every time you come in here,

535
00:36:30,985 --> 00:36:33,904
my gate, gate three,
you act like you own the place.

536
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:35,530
Why would I
wanna own this shithole?

537
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,199
You should shut the fuck up, okay?

538
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,700
You know what?
You need to get laid.

539
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,452
Fuck you!

540
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:42,412
Oh, damn, Mickey!

541
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:44,706
Didn't expect to see you out there today.

542
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:49,545
Wait. Is that the time?

543
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,299
It's 3:30?
That doesn't make any sense.

544
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:55,675
That's right, that's it.

545
00:36:55,676 --> 00:36:57,427
Straight down, hold your line.
Hold your line.

546
00:36:57,428 --> 00:37:01,306
Do you remember...
Do you remember when I left?

547
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:02,682
- What did you say?
- Hold your line.

548
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:06,478
No. No, no, wait, Buzzard.
That's not how you do it. Jeez!

549
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:09,397
Shut it off at the mains.
The switch. Hey!

550
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:11,483
No, no, don't. Stop! Stop!

551
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,777
Shit! What did I tell you?

552
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:15,738
Fucking shitbrain.

553
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:18,241
- Coming through. Line out.
- Hi, Steve.

554
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:23,912
<i>It's that time again.</i>

555
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:27,374
<i>The dinner of your dreams
with Kenneth Marshall.</i>

556
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,668
<i>Who will be this month's
lucky guest of honor?</i>

557
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:31,963
<i>A grand surprise awaits.</i>

558
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:34,673
<i>Hang on to your ship,
because the dove of luck</i>

559
00:37:34,674 --> 00:37:37,092
<i>just might come fluttering its wings</i>

560
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:39,178
<i>with an invitation for you.</i>

561
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:43,390
<i>From dove, with love,
over and out.</i>

562
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:25,389
What is this?

563
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,225
Why aren't you dead?

564
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:30,603
Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, God.

565
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:32,354
No, no, no.

566
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:35,816
You're 18?
They printed you out today?

567
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:38,736
What the fuck is going on?
According to Timo,

568
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:40,905
you should be sliding out of
one of those creeper's assholes

569
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:41,989
right about now.

570
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,117
Do you have to put it like that?

571
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:47,913
Oh, God. I'm completely fucked.

572
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:49,831
What do you mean?

573
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,668
We're Multiples.

574
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,930
I gotta kill you.

575
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,140
Kill me?

576
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:11,644
I mean, you should probably kill yourself
if one of us has to die.

577
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:17,317
It's been, like,
two hours since I was printed.

578
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:20,528
I've barely had a life.

579
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:23,447
Well, I was never dead,
so you don't count.

580
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,075
Go back to the cycler!

581
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:33,040
<i>Multiples.
Where do I even begin?</i>

582
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,126
Mankind is not equipped to deal with

583
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:37,087
the legal and ethical implications

584
00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:39,672
{\an8}of adopting
this human printing technology.

585
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:43,884
{\an8}Please tell me,

586
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:45,928
can any of you
honestly guarantee

587
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:49,181
that the technology
will not be abused?

588
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:51,142
<i>No one in their
R and D department</i>

589
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:53,310
<i>could come up
with a convincing answer.</i>

590
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:55,020
<i>But the real problem was that</i>

591
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:57,106
<i>one of the brains
behind human printing</i>

592
00:39:57,107 --> 00:40:00,234
<i>turned out to be
a certified psychopath,</i>

593
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:02,445
<i>Alan Manikova.</i>

594
00:40:04,364 --> 00:40:06,365
I think it's him.

595
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:07,533
Are you sure?

596
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:10,411
<i>There was this series
of particularly brutal murders</i>

597
00:40:10,412 --> 00:40:14,915
<i>targeting homeless people,
and only one eyewitness account.</i>

598
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,585
<i>But it matched Alan Manikova's
appearance to a tee.</i>

599
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:22,132
<i>The cops thought they had their man,
except Manikova had a sure-fire alibi.</i>

600
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:23,340
<i>At the time of the murder,</i>

601
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,885
<i>he was getting his make-up done
for a children's science show.</i>

602
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:27,470
Come and help me
with the red blood cells

603
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:29,222
and the white blood cells, please?

604
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:34,018
<i>But the cops had his number.</i>

605
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:35,644
<i>When they raided Manikova's house,</i>

606
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:38,522
<i>they brought two sets
of handcuffs and warrants.</i>

607
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:42,776
<i>They were on to him.
Or rather, they were on to them.</i>

608
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:45,029
Which one's Manikova Prime?

609
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,323
You?

610
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:48,908
Or you?

611
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:50,618
<i>Yep, there were two.</i>

612
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:53,412
<i>One for the murder
and one for the alibi.</i>

613
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:56,040
<i>Manikova had printed
another Manikova</i>

614
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,626
<i>without the company knowing.</i>

615
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:00,545
<i>And so
here's a question for you,</i>

616
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,465
<i>are they accomplices or did one
act under the other's orders?</i>

617
00:41:04,466 --> 00:41:07,176
<i>Are these separate,
independent crimes,</i>

618
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:09,637
<i>or were they one person
from the get-go?</i>

619
00:41:09,638 --> 00:41:11,597
<i>They only get half portions in jail,</i>

620
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:13,974
<i>or do they get a full meal each?</i>

621
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:16,811
<i>Police, legal experts, philosophers,</i>

622
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:19,146
<i>everyone was stumped.</i>

623
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:21,607
<i>But while Manikova 1 and 2
were both</i>

624
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:23,484
<i>locked up in an interrogation room,</i>

625
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:25,946
<i>another homeless man
was brutally murdered.</i>

626
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:30,699
<i>Lo and behold, Manikova 3.</i>

627
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:42,087
<i>I think it was
some cheap tabloid reporter</i>

628
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:45,714
<i>who called them Multiples,
or some professor or something.</i>

629
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:47,842
<i>Whoever came up with it, it stuck.</i>

630
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:54,056
<i>And pretty soon the word "Multiples"
spread fear and contempt.</i>

631
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:57,601
So Multiples are an abomination.
They destroy the natural order.

632
00:41:57,602 --> 00:42:01,355
Each soul shall only have one body.
Right?

633
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:03,774
One soul, one body.

634
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:07,611
The Lord, he only blesses
this one-to-one union.

635
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,572
But former congressman Marshall

636
00:42:09,573 --> 00:42:10,990
does have a point worth considering.

637
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:14,201
It would be a shame not to explore

638
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:18,540
the potential application
of this advanced technology.

639
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:22,878
I was happy to receive an
invitation from this committee.

640
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:25,880
{\an8}You were subpoenaed, Mr. Marshall.

641
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:28,966
{\an8}Sure, sure. In any case,

642
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:34,263
{\an8}I want to take this opportunity to speak
as an Expedition Commander.

643
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:36,683
{\an8}Human printing is a sin.

644
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:42,146
Multiples are Satan's work.

645
00:42:42,147 --> 00:42:45,858
However, I've been contemplating
how can we use

646
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:49,112
this abomination
for our common economic benefit.

647
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:51,406
I propose...

648
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:56,202
a trial run of human printing
far from Earth

649
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:58,204
under the strictest oversight.

650
00:42:58,205 --> 00:43:03,000
Limiting such individuals to
one per expedition, per planet,

651
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:06,087
under the designation, "Expendable."

652
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:10,841
Multiples, in the case of Multiples,

653
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:14,929
we exterminate every offending individual

654
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:20,351
<i>in totality, mind and body, all
for the sake of public service.</i>

655
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:22,269
On this Niflheim expedition,

656
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,896
all Multiples will immediately

657
00:43:23,897 --> 00:43:28,819
be arrested, executed,
and permanently deleted.

658
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,783
<i>My head.</i>

659
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:38,870
<i>What the hell is this guy?</i>

660
00:43:39,871 --> 00:43:43,791
<i>Nasha told me that
Mickey 3 was whiny and clingy.</i>

661
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:45,918
<i>5 was, uh, indecisive.</i>

662
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:49,588
<i>And apparently, 8 was pretty
annoying and kinda stupid,</i>

663
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:52,801
<i>but none of them were complete nutjobs.</i>

664
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,555
<i>Even this lunatic is scared
of being a Multiple though.</i>

665
00:43:57,556 --> 00:44:00,100
<i>That's permanent deletion.</i>

666
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:03,352
<i>Trying to trash me in the cycler.</i>

667
00:44:05,897 --> 00:44:07,607
<i>If one of us has to go...</i>

668
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:11,611
<i>it ain't gonna be me.</i>

669
00:44:40,182 --> 00:44:41,891
Half it! Half it!

670
00:44:41,892 --> 00:44:43,768
Half, half, half!

671
00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:46,645
- What?
- Half it. Half!

672
00:44:46,646 --> 00:44:48,063
I'll half it with you.

673
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:50,691
I'll half the rations.
We could split the workload, too.

674
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:53,320
And we can take turns dying.

675
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,866
And you're 18,
so you can take all even numbers

676
00:44:58,867 --> 00:45:03,412
and I-I'll just cover, like,
19, 21, and the odd numbers.

677
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:05,290
Are you afraid to die?

678
00:45:05,582 --> 00:45:06,791
Kinda, yeah.

679
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:10,962
{\an8}You died plenty of times.
What are you so scared of?

680
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:13,590
{\an8}Until now, I died and...

681
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:19,178
I was just born again, you know.

682
00:45:19,179 --> 00:45:23,098
It felt like it was mecontinuing on.

683
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:24,059
But now...

684
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:26,812
once I die...

685
00:45:28,063 --> 00:45:30,649
it'll be over for me.

686
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:33,819
It'll be youliving on.

687
00:45:34,486 --> 00:45:36,279
You get what I mean?

688
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:46,998
I don't like you.

689
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,584
You're such a little bitch.

690
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:51,670
But I'm you.

691
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:54,256
I'm not you.

692
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:57,217
I'm not gonna live like you.

693
00:45:58,009 --> 00:46:02,681
I'm gonna kill you.

694
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:25,370
What the fuck, man?
Are you trying to get noticed?

695
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:29,206
They don't even have cameras.
Take that off, dumbass.

696
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:31,125
Amateur. Your first time?

697
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:32,543
No, no.

698
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:35,505
This is the pure stuff, right?
Undiluted?

699
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,966
Who do you
think you're talking to?

700
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:43,138
This is pure, uncut Oxy.

701
00:46:44,556 --> 00:46:45,682
It's fucking rare.

702
00:46:46,766 --> 00:46:48,517
You only get two Oxyzofol capsules

703
00:46:48,518 --> 00:46:50,311
in one flamethrower, man.

704
00:46:53,231 --> 00:46:54,315
What is that?

705
00:46:54,316 --> 00:46:56,734
I feel it.

706
00:46:56,735 --> 00:46:58,110
What are you doing?

707
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:00,947
That's not a thing. Open it.

708
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,867
Should we just kill that son of a bitch?

709
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:05,993
- I was just joking around.
- What?

710
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:10,665
Don't act surprised.
Your memories are my memories.

711
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,833
The money he blew.

712
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:16,087
That bastard put most
of the loans under our name.

713
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:19,508
In Darius Blank's ledger,
we're the ones on the hook.

714
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,093
That needs fact checking.

715
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:24,929
Have fun, man.

716
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,263
Let's kill him.

717
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:30,893
Are you crazy?
He-He's, like, my only friend.

718
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:33,854
Friend? Same orphanage doesn't mean shit.

719
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:34,897
Wait, wait.

720
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:38,943
Timo.

721
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:40,237
Mickey, what...?

722
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:42,738
Looks like business is blowing up, huh?

723
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:44,282
What're you talking about?

724
00:47:45,158 --> 00:47:47,244
Another junky coming in.

725
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:00,006
Timo!

726
00:48:02,217 --> 00:48:04,426
Hey! Are you mental?

727
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:06,095
Wait until I get out of here.
I'm gonna kill you!

728
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:08,265
The fuck is this?

729
00:48:08,974 --> 00:48:11,392
Come down lower!
You fucking idiot.

730
00:48:27,075 --> 00:48:28,076
Okay.

731
00:48:28,994 --> 00:48:31,704
Okay. Come on.

732
00:48:31,705 --> 00:48:35,083
Mickey, help me.

733
00:48:37,794 --> 00:48:40,505
What is that? Why is it so red?
That looks hot.

734
00:48:41,423 --> 00:48:42,715
What are you doing?

735
00:48:42,716 --> 00:48:44,759
I want you
to have a go at dying,

736
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:46,594
you son of a bitch.

737
00:48:46,595 --> 00:48:48,971
What?

738
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:50,055
Come on!

739
00:48:52,017 --> 00:48:53,935
Stop. Stop!

740
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:07,448
Oh.

741
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:10,160
Is that Mickey?
Hey, what's going on?

742
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,746
Mickey, what are you doing here?

743
00:49:13,246 --> 00:49:18,043
Uh, Timo accidentally fell in,
but, uh, he's all right now.

744
00:49:18,919 --> 00:49:20,712
You wanna keep dealing, motherfucker?

745
00:49:20,837 --> 00:49:22,005
Watch what you say.

746
00:49:26,718 --> 00:49:29,137
What happened? You okay?

747
00:49:30,722 --> 00:49:32,097
What's up with your hand?

748
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:38,312
Just taking out the trash,
and I tripped into the hole.

749
00:49:38,313 --> 00:49:39,772
I would've been a goner
if not for Mickey.

750
00:49:39,773 --> 00:49:42,441
I almost became cycler dust.

751
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:43,568
Hey.

752
00:49:43,902 --> 00:49:45,528
You all right?

753
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:48,697
Told you to stay in bed. It's only been
a few hours since you were printed.

754
00:49:48,698 --> 00:49:50,241
Yeah, I should've done.

755
00:49:50,242 --> 00:49:52,118
- You heard the rumors?
- Huh?

756
00:49:52,577 --> 00:49:55,704
Some guy out there
is dealing undiluted Oxyzofol.

757
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:58,874
What? That's crazy.
That's pretty messed up.

758
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,668
Between us, Timo,

759
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:03,964
a drop here and there before bed
to take the edge off, I get it.

760
00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:06,340
But the pure, uncut stuff
is crossing the line.

761
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:09,802
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
That's bad.

762
00:50:09,803 --> 00:50:12,596
Nasha, take Mickey home.
I'll wrap up here.

763
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:15,058
Yes. Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

764
00:50:30,615 --> 00:50:33,535
Well, today I feel like B6.

765
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:36,787
- B6?
- Yes.

766
00:50:36,788 --> 00:50:39,415
Flying Nasha?

767
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,542
It's definitely
the right place for that one.

768
00:50:41,543 --> 00:50:43,003
What's going on with you?

769
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:45,713
Mm!

770
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:47,339
This isn't like you.

771
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,718
B6?

772
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:52,888
B6 was ours, Nasha.

773
00:51:01,313 --> 00:51:02,438
Mickey?

774
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,522
Hey, brother.

775
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:06,524
I was just headed to your room
to get you, but here you are.

776
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:07,984
Looking good, Mickey.

777
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:09,487
Yes, sir. Okay.

778
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,155
You stand there. Arm around, please.

779
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:15,366
Great. Good.
Uh, big smile, Mickey, would you?

780
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:16,701
- Hold that.
- Yeah, big smile. Great.

781
00:51:16,702 --> 00:51:19,454
Sorry. Could you just stand...
Great, thank you.

782
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:21,998
Okay, and action.

783
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:24,083
Congratulations.

784
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:27,087
This month's lucky winner,
the fortunate soul

785
00:51:27,213 --> 00:51:29,047
who'll have the privilege
of a private dinner...

786
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:30,882
At the camera...
who'll have a private dinner

787
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:33,718
with the one and only
Kenneth Marshall is...

788
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:35,178
Down the barrel.

789
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,554
It's Mickey.

790
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,181
Great. Big smile.

791
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,265
Smile.

792
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,434
There. Amazing. Okay, cut.

793
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:43,645
Now, Marshall wants you
to come ASAP, okay?

794
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:45,939
He's got a whole feast prepared
just for you.

795
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,608
The Lord is truly blessing you
today, Mickey.

796
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:51,027
First, I need to go back to my room.

797
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:53,155
You get to stuff
your fucking face, Mickey.

798
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:58,451
<i>I bet that freak
is probably drooling</i>

799
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,662
<i>all over my beautiful Nasha already.</i>

800
00:52:00,663 --> 00:52:02,957
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

801
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:04,999
<i>What's even more disgusting
is that I'm drooling</i>

802
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,710
<i>at the thought of the tenderloin steak</i>

803
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:08,462
<i>I ordered for Marshall's dinner.</i>

804
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,174
<i>This is so wrong!</i>

805
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:14,551
So glad you seem
to be enjoying it.

806
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:16,887
How's the sauce?

807
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:21,516
Oh.

808
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:24,185
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Please, continue.

809
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:26,105
Yeah, yeah, Mickey. Uh...

810
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:30,651
Listen, going back to everything
that happened with, uh...

811
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:32,485
Jennifer.

812
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,530
Yes, Jennifer.

813
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:36,573
Jennifer...

814
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:37,699
Chilton.

815
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,451
I know, I know.

816
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:43,121
When we lost our dear Jennifer Chilton,

817
00:52:43,122 --> 00:52:48,544
I may have gotten a little angry
and said some terribly unkind things.

818
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:52,006
I know it's late,
and I want to apologize.

819
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:54,340
He's always like this.

820
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,343
Such an adorable man and then
suddenly he's all cutthroat.

821
00:52:59,305 --> 00:53:01,807
Darling, I'm trying
to make it here. Okay?

822
00:53:02,475 --> 00:53:06,102
Sorry. You're still squishy,
fresh out of the printer.

823
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:07,770
Continue feeding yourself.

824
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:12,942
Oh. Anyway, we have
another special guest here.

825
00:53:12,943 --> 00:53:14,069
Hi, Kai.

826
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,112
Sorry, I'm late.

827
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:18,364
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

828
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,449
Come. Come.

829
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,285
- It's good to see you.
- Sit.

830
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:25,998
You okay? Emotionally?

831
00:53:26,457 --> 00:53:28,792
Yeah, I feel fine, sir.
Thank you.

832
00:53:28,793 --> 00:53:32,338
I'm glad to hear it, Kai.
I'm so sorry about Jennifer.

833
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:36,090
I hear you were extremely close.
Your best friend.

834
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,343
But I knew you'd stay strong
throughout it all.

835
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:40,094
Thank you, ma'am.

836
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:43,516
But we didn't invite you here
simply to comfort you.

837
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:47,228
We've had our eyes on you, Katz.

838
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,395
- On me, sir?
- Mmm.

839
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,481
May I ask why?

840
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:53,359
You're one of us.

841
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:57,238
With your impeccable genetics,

842
00:53:57,363 --> 00:54:00,740
you are the perfect specimen
for the colony I envision.

843
00:54:03,369 --> 00:54:04,911
Well, thank you, sir.

844
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:08,540
That's why the church,
I mean, um, company,

845
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:11,669
has chosen me to lead this expedition.

846
00:54:11,794 --> 00:54:14,964
The Earth's beyond saving
with all its muddy people.

847
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,091
But you, you're something special,

848
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:20,760
and I'm creating a world

849
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:23,638
on a pure white planet
full of superior people.

850
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,558
Like you. And us.
Isn't that right, darling?

851
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,477
- Yes. Mmm. It's his vision.
- My vision.

852
00:54:29,478 --> 00:54:31,187
- His sensibilities.
- Sensibility.

853
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:34,232
But let's be honest,
with your medical records in hand,

854
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,609
you ran to join our expedition

855
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,737
instead of one of those pathetic planets

856
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:40,822
where they plant microchips

857
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:43,366
in their artificially
inseminated baby embryos.

858
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,034
You really are the perfect candidate

859
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:47,412
for Niflheim's
natural child birthing program,

860
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:50,123
aren't you, dear?

861
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:53,627
Mr. Marshall, am I just a uterus to you?

862
00:54:56,714 --> 00:55:01,176
No! No, no, no.
It's nothing like that, Kai.

863
00:55:01,177 --> 00:55:04,012
No, this man is not one
to objectify women.

864
00:55:04,013 --> 00:55:08,016
All my husband means to say
is he has very high standards.

865
00:55:08,017 --> 00:55:10,810
His only dream is
of a planet exclusively

866
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,520
for a pure human race.

867
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:16,399
That consumes real crops,
and real meat,

868
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,028
and dinners with delicate,
delicious sauces.

869
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:23,781
Oh, sauce is the true
litmus test of civilization.

870
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:26,284
People who devour burnt meat
are barbarians.

871
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:29,204
Do try the sauce, Kai.
Here, I made it myself.

872
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:30,706
Oh. Thank you.

873
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,837
But first, I'd like to say a few
words in Jennifer's memory.

874
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,255
A prayer.

875
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:41,342
Always ready for a prayer.

876
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:45,136
Jennifer, when I first met you
at the cafeteria

877
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:46,639
four years ago...

878
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:58,192
You were...

879
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,071
Dear Lord...

880
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:05,157
Jennifer Chilton's one and only soul

881
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:09,328
was taken
from her wonderful friend, Kai.

882
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:12,122
Dear Lord...

883
00:56:12,832 --> 00:56:16,334

00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:06,342
Apologies, sir.
This is embarrassing.

896
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:07,969
The cultured meat that he just ate

897
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,305
includes an experimental
growth hormone.

898
00:57:10,306 --> 00:57:13,850
Obviously, it's still risky.
I'm so very sorry, sir.

899
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:16,895
You're sure it's not
because he was eating so much?

900
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,564
He was stuffing his friggin' pie hole.

901
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:22,233
No, not quite, sir. You see
the red rash on his neck.

902
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:24,444
It's a side effect
of the growth hormone.

903
00:57:24,445 --> 00:57:26,446
- Ah.
- I'm so ashamed.

904
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:30,825
I take full responsibility and
resign my position immediately.

905
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:35,622
No, no, no, not at all.
I mean, artificial meat is crap.

906
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:37,123
How are we supposed to improve it

907
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,835
unless we fail upward to perfection?

908
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,586
No. Arkady...

909
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:44,715
stand tall in your failures
like me, my friend.

910
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:47,718
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

911
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:49,093
Commander.

912
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,971
So you are testing out
your in-flight TV dinner on him?

913
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,389
In-flight TV dinner?

914
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:57,520
Is that what the young troops
are calling it now?

915
00:57:58,229 --> 00:57:59,312
Excuse me.

916
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,274
Are you in a lot of pain?

917
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:05,652
I'm being punished.

918
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:08,488
- What?
- It's my punishment.

919
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:11,784
I should've gone to Nasha
and not come here.

920
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:16,205
Ew.

921
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:19,124
Dorothy, bring me Purple Joe.

922
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,293
Sir, you remember the special painkiller

923
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,585
we've been developing?

924
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:23,962
Yeah, Purple Joe.

925
00:58:23,963 --> 00:58:26,005
It's a quick fix
for injured agents, right?

926
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:28,967
Yeah. Since Mickey here
is in such awful pain,

927
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:31,511
it's a perfect opportunity
to try a little test, so...

928
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:33,222
- Give it to him.
- Great, all right.

929
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:44,441
Come on, Purple Joe.

930
00:58:46,402 --> 00:58:48,279
Okay, here we go.

931
00:58:52,032 --> 00:58:53,741
Don't touch him, please.

932
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,119
Mickey, can you see me?

933
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,454
Mickey? Mickey!

934
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:00,708
- Oh, sorry.
- Get back down there.

935
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,169
Mickey? Mickey?

936
00:59:03,294 --> 00:59:04,711
Oh, God. Oh, God.

937
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:11,093
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

938
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:15,597
Oh. What do we do?

939
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:23,354
Apologies, sir.
The painkiller's not working.

940
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,814
Oh.

941
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:32,322
Don't film this,
Preston. Please, turn it off.

942
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,825
This is better, right?
More humane.

943
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:36,910
Yes, sir. More humane.

944
00:59:36,911 --> 00:59:39,580
- No, no, no. What are you doing?
- Huh?

945
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:41,998
You can't tear a hole
in my fucking carpet.

946
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:44,794
Well, we'll just shoot him
from the side.

947
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:46,711
But what about the blood?

948
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:49,422
This is a Persian Tabriz!

949
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:50,924
Honey, calm down.

950
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:51,884
Shoot now.

951
00:59:52,343 --> 00:59:54,177
What the hell is going on?

952
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:57,014
This was supposed to be
a fucking dinner!

953
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,016
He's your guest.

954
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:02,435
Agent Kai Katz, what the hell's
going on with you?

955
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:05,688
He's a meat matrix.
He's a goddamn print job.

956
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,107
An Expendable.

957
01:00:07,525 --> 01:00:09,484
He signed up for this.

958
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:10,694
Yes, sir.

959
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,695
This is for our planet, agent.

960
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,239
I'm sorry, sir.

961
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,490
Commander.

962
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:20,329
Please don't shoot.

963
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:24,041
I'm okay now.

964
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,293
I don't think so.

965
01:00:27,128 --> 01:00:29,254
He still seems
like he's in a lot of pain.

966
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:30,923
Of course he is.

967
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:38,889
Are you really okay?

968
01:00:40,266 --> 01:00:42,725
Just... thank you for dinner.

969
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:49,858
My room's just there.
You need to clean up and rest, Mickey.

970
01:00:51,694 --> 01:00:55,029
Don't worry about me.
I can walk.

971
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:58,450
I just need to get back
to my room. Nasha's about to...

972
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,953
Actually, we're going to mine.

973
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,971
Here. It's dry.

974
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,266
I drink this
whenever I have a stomach ache.

975
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:28,314
It's from Earth. It's precious.
So I've been saving it.

976
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,529
But I made some for you.

977
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,201
- Thanks.
- Sit.

978
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:53,005
You know, Mickey,
I didn't want to ask you this.

979
01:01:54,632 --> 01:01:59,386
But just this once, okay?
And I'm so sorry.

980
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:11,899
What's it like... dying?

981
01:02:18,072 --> 01:02:19,782
You asking because of Jennifer?

982
01:02:21,826 --> 01:02:23,035
Yeah.

983
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:30,876
We locked eyes in the last moment.

984
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:40,052
What did she feel as all that
ice came crashing down on her?

985
01:02:43,556 --> 01:02:45,558
I can't stop thinking about it.

986
01:02:49,687 --> 01:02:50,896
Um...

987
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:56,694
I don't think it's what I...
what I usually feel. It's...

988
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,864
Well, I die so often...

989
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:05,703
Because you know you're
going to wake up again, right?

990
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,999
Because you die knowing that.

991
01:03:15,212 --> 01:03:16,714
No...

992
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:22,470
I always feel scared.

993
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:30,936
It's terrible, dying. I hate it.

994
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:40,279
No matter how many times
I go through it, it's scary.

995
01:03:42,615 --> 01:03:46,452
Still. Always, every time.

996
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,707
But you're here.

997
01:03:55,794 --> 01:03:57,378
And Jennifer isn't.

998
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:01,758
Out there.

999
01:04:03,593 --> 01:04:05,303
The entire universe.

1000
01:04:09,182 --> 01:04:10,683
She's nowhere.

1001
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:30,537
You don't look like you were printed out.

1002
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:38,628
You're just a person.

1003
01:04:44,634 --> 01:04:46,803
Are you and Nasha open?

1004
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:50,849
I have to go.

1005
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:55,520
Nasha, please forgive me.

1006
01:04:56,312 --> 01:04:59,356
The guy that you're having sex with...

1007
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:01,567
that's not me.

1008
01:05:04,028 --> 01:05:05,280
That's not me!

1009
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:10,535
You motherfucker.
How dare you touch her!

1010
01:05:33,391 --> 01:05:34,684
17!

1011
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:39,063
I knew this would happen
at some point.

1012
01:05:39,856 --> 01:05:43,443
Wait, wait, wait. Stand-stand...
Stand next to each other.

1013
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,361
Wait, take this off.

1014
01:05:45,778 --> 01:05:46,778
What?

1015
01:05:46,779 --> 01:05:48,030
Yeah, I want you to look the same.

1016
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,948
Mmm.

1017
01:05:57,957 --> 01:05:59,626
Oh, my God.

1018
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:09,885
Nasha, uh, h-how can you
laugh right now?

1019
01:06:09,886 --> 01:06:12,638
This is a Multiples violation.
I'm... I'm as good as dead.

1020
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:15,557
Oh, come on!

1021
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:18,435
When else am I gonna get this
chance? I mean, think about it.

1022
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:21,313
You would be so psyched
if there were two of me.

1023
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:29,905
This is "Mild Mickey."
And this is "Habanero Mickey."

1024
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:34,869
This is so exciting!

1025
01:06:36,996 --> 01:06:38,957
It's so different.

1026
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:42,252
Nasha, you're different, too.
You don't seem like yourself.

1027
01:06:46,589 --> 01:06:48,340
Oh, Jesus.

1028
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:50,592
You just did Oxyzofol with him?

1029
01:06:50,593 --> 01:06:53,846
Just a teeny tiny bit,
with a ton of water.

1030
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:54,930
Do you want some?

1031
01:06:54,931 --> 01:06:56,558
Yeah, yeah, relax.

1032
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,892
Just take it easy.

1033
01:06:58,893 --> 01:07:00,227
Nasha!

1034
01:07:00,228 --> 01:07:02,062
This piece of shit
just tried to kill me earlier.

1035
01:07:02,063 --> 01:07:05,191
Right here in this room.
Look, I was bleeding.

1036
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:08,694
Like you weren't thinking
of trying the same thing.

1037
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:10,404
I saw you sneaking up behind me!

1038
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:13,241
Hey, hey, hey, shut up. Shut up.

1039
01:07:13,908 --> 01:07:15,076
Now sit down.

1040
01:07:16,536 --> 01:07:18,037
Okay, attention.

1041
01:07:18,913 --> 01:07:21,748
From now on, I'm gonna feed
you both as often as I can,

1042
01:07:21,749 --> 01:07:23,585
so be good boys, and don't fight.

1043
01:07:24,335 --> 01:07:26,963
Now, 18 tells me you guys
have sorted it out already.

1044
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,674
Eat half, work half.

1045
01:07:30,675 --> 01:07:33,136
Alternating deaths, evens and odds.

1046
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:36,054
It's a great system.

1047
01:07:36,055 --> 01:07:39,934
Negotiation done,
so everyone just chill.

1048
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:42,437
Okay?

1049
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:15,762
Can you leave us alone
for a second?

1050
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,097
Why? What's the problem?

1051
01:08:20,599 --> 01:08:22,726
God damn it, I'm leaving.

1052
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:27,772
Oh, you're such a baby.
This guy needs some Oxyzofol.

1053
01:08:27,773 --> 01:08:29,483
You can relax.

1054
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:01,683
Is that the door?

1055
01:09:06,728 --> 01:09:07,938
Oh.

1056
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:17,282
Oh, fuck.

1057
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:24,706
Kai!

1058
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:27,584
Wait up, let's talk.

1059
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:30,127
And talk about what?

1060
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:32,004
I don't care about your private life.

1061
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:35,257
Okay. Fine. But what's up?

1062
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:36,799
What's the rush?
Where are you going?

1063
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,178
I just witnessed a Multiples violation
with my own eyes.

1064
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:42,389
As an agent, I have a duty to report it.

1065
01:09:47,978 --> 01:09:49,481
Okay, fine.

1066
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:53,067
But since when have you
been coming to Mickey's room?

1067
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,154
This is your first time, right?

1068
01:09:58,948 --> 01:10:01,408
What's up with you and Kai, bro?
Why was she here?

1069
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:04,119
Oh, man.
What are we supposed to do now?

1070
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,704
She's gonna go straight to Marshall

1071
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:07,789
and report us, isn't she?

1072
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:11,294
You need to relax.
Nasha's handling it.

1073
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:14,505
She can convince anybody of anything.

1074
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:18,301
Oh, my God. Besides...

1075
01:10:19,969 --> 01:10:23,056
{\an8}this moron is busy with his clown show.

1076
01:10:24,432 --> 01:10:27,684
{\an8}<i>...who wander in the dust and lay them</i>

1077
01:10:27,685 --> 01:10:31,688
{\an8}<i>on this beautiful, manly,
handsome, hunking...</i>

1078
01:10:31,689 --> 01:10:35,567
{\an8}This fucker. Such an attention whore.

1079
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:40,740
{\an8}<i>...oozing with charisma... rock!</i>

1080
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,534
And what did that asshole
serve for dinner?

1081
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:44,953
Was it good at least?

1082
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:49,582
You really wanna know
what went down at that dinner?

1083
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:54,796
So, the one with 17 on his chest,

1084
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:58,257
that's the Mickey
that was in my room just before?

1085
01:10:58,258 --> 01:10:59,342
Mm-hmm.

1086
01:11:00,426 --> 01:11:03,554
And the one you were grabbing?

1087
01:11:03,555 --> 01:11:05,180
He's 18, right?

1088
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:06,099
Yeah.

1089
01:11:07,725 --> 01:11:08,726
Okay.

1090
01:11:13,314 --> 01:11:15,525
You can have 18, and I'll take 17.

1091
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:17,485
What?

1092
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:20,279
There's two of them.
Why not share?

1093
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,157
<i>♪ One and only ♪</i>

1094
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:25,033
So, let me get this straight.

1095
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:28,996
You were shitting your pants on the floor,

1096
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:35,044
and he comes up and stabs you
in the neck with a syringe?

1097
01:11:37,255 --> 01:11:38,715
That's what happened?

1098
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:41,717
I wasn't, like, shitting my pants.

1099
01:11:41,718 --> 01:11:44,512
I was just puking up a little bit.

1100
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:46,722
That's not the point!

1101
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:49,808
I've seen you rubbing up on Mickey
every chance you get, you fuckface.

1102
01:11:49,809 --> 01:11:52,561
You know, I've always wanted
to kick the living shit out of you.

1103
01:11:52,562 --> 01:11:55,397
Nasha, come on,
I'm trying to be considerate.

1104
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:59,902
Mickey 17 was about to double-dip,

1105
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:02,030
if you know what I mean.

1106
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:05,866
Move on from you to me.
In fact, we almost...

1107
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:09,161
- Double-dip? Shut up!
- Oh.

1108
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:11,164
Mickey is not some cookie
you can split in half.

1109
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:14,918
17 and 18 are both Mickey.
Both my Mickey.

1110
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:17,879
So, then after Marshall
fucks you sideways,

1111
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:21,089
you really let him have it, right?
Right?

1112
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:23,551
What did you say?

1113
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:29,807
I just said,
"Thank you for dinner."

1114
01:12:34,854 --> 01:12:35,855
You said what?

1115
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:39,316
"Thank you for dinner."

1116
01:12:39,317 --> 01:12:40,902
Thank you for fucking what?

1117
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:44,363
For putting...
a gun to your head

1118
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,782
before he blows your brains out?

1119
01:12:46,783 --> 01:12:49,368
God, you're such a little bitch!

1120
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:51,370
Fucking loser!

1121
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:57,502
I guess... I guess I am kind of a loser.

1122
01:12:57,627 --> 01:12:58,753
What?

1123
01:13:00,713 --> 01:13:03,883
Is that what you are?

1124
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:06,552
Huh? Is it?

1125
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:09,304
<i>♪ Free at last ♪</i>

1126
01:13:09,305 --> 01:13:11,849
<i>♪ We're going to the Promised Land ♪</i>

1127
01:13:20,024 --> 01:13:23,027
<i>♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪</i>

1128
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:30,827
It's not your fault.

1129
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:35,289
<i>♪ Amen! ♪</i>

1130
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:36,708
{\an8} Let's kill that fucker.

1131
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:40,002
This guy with the killing.

1132
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:42,963
"Kill this, kill that.
Why don't we kill everybody?"

1133
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:45,258
You can stay here
and watch TV if you want.

1134
01:13:45,383 --> 01:13:47,135
Wait, wait, wait.

1135
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:50,889
You can't negotiate shit
with that attitude.

1136
01:13:52,098 --> 01:13:53,266
I mean, Jesus.

1137
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:57,060
You're high on Oxyzofol.

1138
01:13:58,813 --> 01:13:59,856
Mickey?

1139
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,275
Hey, what the...?

1140
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:05,068
- He-He has your gun.
- Gun?

1141
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:06,778
We have to stop him.

1142
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:09,240
What? Where's he going?

1143
01:14:10,992 --> 01:14:14,453
Why? Why, why is Commander Marshall

1144
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:17,247
cutting into that big,
beautiful, handsome rock?

1145
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:27,549
Ooh!

1146
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,968
Ooh.

1147
01:14:31,387 --> 01:14:35,307
Beautiful. It's sleek, hot, exquisite.

1148
01:14:35,308 --> 01:14:36,308
Exquisite.

1149
01:14:36,309 --> 01:14:38,560
This is where our names
will be etched.

1150
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:41,855
Mine and yours. And you!

1151
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:45,860
And you! And you! And you!

1152
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:49,030
And you, my beautiful Ylfa.

1153
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,283
Almost every single one of you

1154
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:55,744
will be remembered
throughout history

1155
01:14:55,745 --> 01:15:00,707
as the proud founders
of Niflheim's first generation.

1156
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:02,669
Yes!

1157
01:15:03,086 --> 01:15:07,131
Our cornerstone black diamond.

1158
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:09,550
Beautiful, shimmering purity.

1159
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:13,929
This rock will become the
symbolic monument of Niflheim,

1160
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:16,807
the one and only
pure colony planet.

1161
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:18,016
- The one and only...
- One and only.

1162
01:15:18,017 --> 01:15:18,934
Niflheim!

1163
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:20,144
The one and only

1164
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:21,061
Niflheim.

1165
01:15:21,062 --> 01:15:24,107
The one and only!

1166
01:16:08,151 --> 01:16:09,527
No, don't touch it, sir.

1167
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:11,612
Maybe it's contagious.

1168
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:13,280
It's contagious!

1169
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:16,618
You touch it, you die!

1170
01:16:18,077 --> 01:16:19,745
- Mickey?
- Everyone run!

1171
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:21,331
- Stop! Stop!
- Mickey!

1172
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:23,333
- Stop! Go back!
- Mickey!

1173
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:26,419
Seal the exit!
Isolate the chamber!

1174
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,424
Stay calm, God damn it.

1175
01:16:32,425 --> 01:16:33,801
Sterilization.

1176
01:16:37,346 --> 01:16:40,515
Initiate stage one. Agents!

1177
01:16:40,516 --> 01:16:42,517
Into your hazmat suit!

1178
01:16:42,518 --> 01:16:43,601
- Arkady.
- Yes!

1179
01:16:43,602 --> 01:16:45,229
- Move your ass.
- Okay!

1180
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:51,484
Capture it!

1181
01:16:51,485 --> 01:16:53,028
Capture it alive!

1182
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:59,076
It's here! It's here! That's it!

1183
01:16:59,535 --> 01:17:00,868
That's it.

1184
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:03,204
Get it, get it, get it.

1185
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:05,249
Get... Get... God damn it!

1186
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:10,545
Hey, Expendable,
you don't need a hazmat suit.

1187
01:17:10,546 --> 01:17:12,422
Catch the goddamn thing!

1188
01:17:27,437 --> 01:17:29,814
Catch that thing now, you idiot!

1189
01:17:29,815 --> 01:17:30,858
Grab it!

1190
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:32,526
Mickey!

1191
01:17:35,487 --> 01:17:36,780
Where's the other Mickey?

1192
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:39,198
I don't know!

1193
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,450
Mickey, in here!
In here. Come on!

1194
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:44,453
Come on, we got it! We got it!

1195
01:17:44,454 --> 01:17:46,622
No, no, no. Take the gun!

1196
01:17:50,002 --> 01:17:51,503
Mickey, no!

1197
01:17:56,383 --> 01:17:58,051
Multiples.

1198
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,137
Don't shoot.
I've got him under control.

1199
01:18:01,138 --> 01:18:02,556
Don't shoot.

1200
01:18:03,348 --> 01:18:06,310
Yes. Calm down. Calm down.

1201
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:09,020
We have everything under control.

1202
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:11,940
You rock, Marshall! Bravo!

1203
01:18:12,816 --> 01:18:19,030
Those lowlife Multiples have ruined
our precious symbol of...

1204
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:26,704
Kill it!

1205
01:18:26,705 --> 01:18:28,539
Get down, sir.

1206
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:29,917
Open fire!

1207
01:18:37,925 --> 01:18:39,384
Sterilize me!

1208
01:18:55,943 --> 01:18:58,487
Arrest him. Fucking Multiples.

1209
01:19:18,173 --> 01:19:19,882
Tell the Committee
you were aiming at the creeper

1210
01:19:19,883 --> 01:19:20,884
behind Marshall.

1211
01:19:21,635 --> 01:19:23,595
Otherwise, you could get
permanently deleted.

1212
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,557
Fuck that shit.

1213
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,686
You really think Captain Creampie's
gonna let us live?

1214
01:19:33,313 --> 01:19:34,814
He's probably gonna shoot us himself.

1215
01:19:34,815 --> 01:19:37,067
He's a nutjob.

1216
01:19:37,734 --> 01:19:39,361
Doesn't listen to anybody.

1217
01:19:40,112 --> 01:19:43,030
He's the biggest, dumbest nutjob
out of all the Mickeys.

1218
01:19:43,031 --> 01:19:44,741
And that's saying something.

1219
01:19:45,742 --> 01:19:48,369
He screwed my entire life up.

1220
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:49,662
Oh, really?

1221
01:19:49,663 --> 01:19:52,290
We all got fucked the minute
you decided not to die

1222
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,626
and came crawling home to mummy.

1223
01:19:54,751 --> 01:19:57,713
That wasn't my fault.
That was a creeper's fault.

1224
01:19:59,131 --> 01:20:00,132
Creeper?

1225
01:20:00,757 --> 01:20:03,885
Well, if that creeper's eaten me
like it was supposed to,

1226
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:05,887
then we wouldn't be in this situation,

1227
01:20:05,888 --> 01:20:08,307
but they all kicked me out

1228
01:20:09,057 --> 01:20:10,726
and now I'm a goddamn Multiple.

1229
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:12,518
They kicked you out?

1230
01:20:12,519 --> 01:20:13,520
Yeah.

1231
01:20:14,438 --> 01:20:17,023
They were all pushing me
and pulling me,

1232
01:20:17,024 --> 01:20:20,652
and I mean, they all threw me
back into the snow.

1233
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:26,073
Maybe I don't look tasty enough
or I smell off.

1234
01:20:26,074 --> 01:20:27,493
I don't know.

1235
01:20:28,785 --> 01:20:30,704
Maybe if I was in some kind of sauce.

1236
01:20:31,371 --> 01:20:32,539
Hold on.

1237
01:20:34,249 --> 01:20:36,293
You're telling me they saved you?

1238
01:20:37,419 --> 01:20:38,712
Think about it.

1239
01:20:39,129 --> 01:20:41,506
You should have died
in that crevasse.

1240
01:20:41,507 --> 01:20:43,425
The creepers saved you.

1241
01:20:44,426 --> 01:20:46,720
Uh, yeah, I guess
if you put it like that...

1242
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:51,642
<i>they were sorta seeing me off.</i>

1243
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,852
Maybe I should have said thank you.

1244
01:20:54,853 --> 01:20:56,063
Yeah.

1245
01:20:56,647 --> 01:20:59,065
I don't think they were gonna eat you.

1246
01:20:59,066 --> 01:21:01,068
Right?

1247
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:03,778
Oh, my God.

1248
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:06,531
We have to report this to Science.
They save humans.

1249
01:21:06,532 --> 01:21:09,034
Yeah. People need to know this.

1250
01:21:10,118 --> 01:21:11,829
They saved me.

1251
01:21:22,339 --> 01:21:24,757
Hey. Where's the fucking ladder?

1252
01:21:24,758 --> 01:21:26,759
You were supposed to bring
a fucking ladder.

1253
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,345
I don't know...

1254
01:21:29,263 --> 01:21:31,598
Look, here. Let me help.

1255
01:21:32,141 --> 01:21:34,934
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop.
I'll do it myself.

1256
01:21:34,935 --> 01:21:37,437
I'm coming down myself.
Get the fuck off.

1257
01:21:41,316 --> 01:21:42,150
Come on.

1258
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:43,277
Hey, Timo.

1259
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:44,778
What are you doing here?

1260
01:21:45,487 --> 01:21:46,655
Oh, wow.

1261
01:21:47,072 --> 01:21:49,323
You two really are Multiples, huh?

1262
01:21:49,324 --> 01:21:53,161
But it's you. Yeah, I see it
in that schmuck face of yours.

1263
01:21:53,162 --> 01:21:55,997
You're the one who gave me this. Right?

1264
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:58,750
Oopsie.

1265
01:21:59,126 --> 01:22:01,670
Here you go, guys.
You guys must be starving.

1266
01:22:02,588 --> 01:22:04,715
Thanks, man.
I knew you'd be coming for us.

1267
01:22:06,967 --> 01:22:08,260
What are you up to?

1268
01:22:09,178 --> 01:22:10,429
What's all that?

1269
01:22:10,888 --> 01:22:13,015
So, um,

1270
01:22:13,974 --> 01:22:15,058
here's the thing.

1271
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,063
I need to shoot a video
and send it to Earth, ASAP.

1272
01:22:20,564 --> 01:22:22,899
Video? To Earth?

1273
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,359
Yeah. Um...

1274
01:22:24,735 --> 01:22:26,236
It's for...

1275
01:22:27,237 --> 01:22:28,238
Darius Blank.

1276
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:31,074
Darius Blank. Who's that?

1277
01:22:34,995 --> 01:22:37,581
Found this at my door today.

1278
01:22:38,457 --> 01:22:40,584
It's written by hand.

1279
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:42,586
It's beautiful handwriting.

1280
01:22:45,547 --> 01:22:47,507
This is from Darius Blank's associate?

1281
01:22:47,508 --> 01:22:50,301
Yeah. His associate.

1282
01:22:50,302 --> 01:22:53,138
Fucking, his associate.

1283
01:22:54,014 --> 01:22:56,098
You know what I mean?
Like, of course.

1284
01:22:56,099 --> 01:22:59,477
Of course, the loan shark
of all fucking loan sharks

1285
01:22:59,478 --> 01:23:01,479
would figure out a way
to send one of his guys

1286
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,481
to follow us all the way here,

1287
01:23:03,482 --> 01:23:05,942
to Niflheim, to where we are, right now!

1288
01:23:05,943 --> 01:23:08,027
That's like a million
fucking miles from Ulaanbaatar.

1289
01:23:08,028 --> 01:23:10,446
You know what I'm talking about?
Do you know how far that is?

1290
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:14,492
"No matter what pittance you managed
to scrape together, we found

1291
01:23:14,493 --> 01:23:18,996
that sending it to Earth will cost you
an intergalactic transfer fee.

1292
01:23:18,997 --> 01:23:22,376
More than... half the total sum."

1293
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:26,087
The fucking associate!
I have no idea who that is!

1294
01:23:26,088 --> 01:23:29,882
I don't know who that is.
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1295
01:23:29,883 --> 01:23:32,510
"Send a visual work of art.

1296
01:23:32,511 --> 01:23:36,681
A video file that captures
the details of death."

1297
01:23:36,682 --> 01:23:38,016
Read the back.

1298
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:41,727
It says chop up into
a minimum of 13 pieces.

1299
01:23:41,728 --> 01:23:44,689
Chop up? What the fuck is this?

1300
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:47,191
Hey! What did I say
about the close-up?

1301
01:23:47,192 --> 01:23:48,860
Close-up is more important, okay?

1302
01:23:48,861 --> 01:23:50,361
So, take the 32K camera,

1303
01:23:50,362 --> 01:23:52,905
and put it over here
for Mr. Darius Blank.

1304
01:23:52,906 --> 01:23:54,116
You understand?

1305
01:23:58,745 --> 01:24:00,164
I'm sorry, Mickey.

1306
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:04,918
Now, you see, it's all there.
Right? In the letter.

1307
01:24:05,043 --> 01:24:06,836
If I shoot this video,
and I send it to him,

1308
01:24:06,837 --> 01:24:08,421
he'll let me live.

1309
01:24:10,299 --> 01:24:13,759
If I don't, they're gonna
send their guy,

1310
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,929
and he's gonna kill me first.

1311
01:24:17,431 --> 01:24:19,016
What am I supposed to do?

1312
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:22,603
Come on, dude.
If I die, that's it for me.

1313
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:24,437
But you're an Expendable.

1314
01:24:24,438 --> 01:24:26,482
They'll just
print you right back out.

1315
01:24:27,483 --> 01:24:32,028
Please, Mickey, I'm your friend.

1316
01:24:32,029 --> 01:24:34,614
Okay, please, do this
for your friend. One time.

1317
01:24:34,615 --> 01:24:37,201
You gotta do this for me, man,
I'm your brother.

1318
01:24:40,412 --> 01:24:44,040
I'm sorry.

1319
01:24:44,041 --> 01:24:45,751
I'm sorry.

1320
01:24:45,876 --> 01:24:48,086
I'm so sorry.

1321
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:51,631
I'm so sorry.

1322
01:24:51,632 --> 01:24:53,174
Oh, shit.

1323
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:55,676
Should have killed this guy
when we had the chance.

1324
01:24:55,677 --> 01:24:58,846
You gotta just do this
for me this one time.

1325
01:24:58,847 --> 01:25:00,848
That's all I'm asking.
I'm so sorry.

1326
01:25:00,849 --> 01:25:04,685
Stop crying, you prick!
Getting on my fucking nerves!

1327
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,856
Why don't you guys do
Rock, Paper, Scissors, okay?

1328
01:25:08,857 --> 01:25:11,276
And then we'll just
shoot the loser, yeah?

1329
01:25:11,568 --> 01:25:14,238
No? All right. Shoot him.

1330
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:16,030
Him?

1331
01:25:16,031 --> 01:25:17,198
Yeah, him.

1332
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,450
I wasn't expecting that.
Thought you'd choose him.

1333
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:22,036
Yeah, you'd think so, but
the soft one is easier. Come on.

1334
01:25:22,037 --> 01:25:22,830
Okay.

1335
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,971
You're a dumb fucking bitch, Timo.

1336
01:25:41,014 --> 01:25:43,015
If you do this,
and what's-his-face lets you live,

1337
01:25:43,016 --> 01:25:45,059
you think that'll be the end of it?

1338
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:48,105
You don't think I'll tear you
to fucking pieces myself?

1339
01:25:48,856 --> 01:25:51,065
Oh, my God.
What is the big deal?

1340
01:25:51,066 --> 01:25:53,276
Aw, just take me instead.

1341
01:25:53,277 --> 01:25:54,570
Tie him up.

1342
01:25:55,904 --> 01:25:57,071
What?

1343
01:25:57,072 --> 01:25:59,783
Just chop me up, not him.

1344
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:01,243
Look at him.

1345
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:04,203
Shot him one time with
the Taser, it's like he just

1346
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:07,582
boofed a fucking electric eel, man.

1347
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:11,128
But you can chop my whole body
up into ten Mickey chunks,

1348
01:26:11,587 --> 01:26:14,923
and I'll still be fresh
as the freshest sashimi.

1349
01:26:15,966 --> 01:26:17,092
Head held high.

1350
01:26:17,593 --> 01:26:19,178
Darius will love that.

1351
01:26:20,596 --> 01:26:22,014
I just need
a little of your help.

1352
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,474
My help?

1353
01:26:24,308 --> 01:26:25,350
Um...

1354
01:26:26,268 --> 01:26:30,189
I kinda need more of that... Oxyzofol.

1355
01:26:32,983 --> 01:26:34,233
Yeah, I got some Oxy.

1356
01:26:34,234 --> 01:26:35,569
But undiluted.

1357
01:26:37,529 --> 01:26:38,946
You want...

1358
01:26:38,947 --> 01:26:41,157
You want undiluted Oxy
right now?

1359
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:43,410
Yeah.

1360
01:26:44,119 --> 01:26:46,163
Just think of it as the...

1361
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:49,332
Think of it as the final...

1362
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:53,003
cigarette before execution.

1363
01:26:55,047 --> 01:26:57,132
It's the least you could do for a friend.

1364
01:26:59,176 --> 01:27:01,219
- Give him yours.
- What?

1365
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:02,887
- Come on.
- No.

1366
01:27:02,888 --> 01:27:05,182
I'll give you a freebie next time.
You know me.

1367
01:27:07,392 --> 01:27:08,936
This was expensive.

1368
01:27:15,275 --> 01:27:15,943
The keys.

1369
01:27:27,371 --> 01:27:28,455
Nasha.

1370
01:27:28,956 --> 01:27:29,957
Don't.

1371
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:32,501
Do it.

1372
01:27:37,214 --> 01:27:39,216
Nasha, what are you doing?

1373
01:27:40,884 --> 01:27:42,343
What's going on here?

1374
01:27:42,344 --> 01:27:45,012
Nasha. Stay put.

1375
01:27:47,933 --> 01:27:50,017
<i>That did kind of shock me a bit.</i>

1376
01:27:50,018 --> 01:27:52,645
<i>I mean, she literally was gonna
cut his head off</i>

1377
01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:54,064
<i>with a chain saw.</i>

1378
01:27:54,815 --> 01:28:00,237
<i>Uh, but then, I thought about
it, and I was so... touched.</i>

1379
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,869
<i>She's the only person who'd
ever lose it like that over me.</i>

1380
01:28:08,412 --> 01:28:10,330
<i>And it wasn't the first time either.</i>

1381
01:28:12,499 --> 01:28:14,960
Hello? Can we help you?

1382
01:28:15,085 --> 01:28:16,628
Nasha, just go.

1383
01:28:17,546 --> 01:28:18,754
- Take it off.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1384
01:28:18,755 --> 01:28:19,839
- I need to go in there.
- What are you doing?

1385
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,090
Take it off.
I am going in there.

1386
01:28:21,091 --> 01:28:22,133
You've left him in there alone.

1387
01:28:22,134 --> 01:28:23,593
But that's his job.

1388
01:28:23,594 --> 01:28:25,178
I don't care if it's his job.

1389
01:28:25,179 --> 01:28:27,138
Okay, look,
I'm gonna call security.

1390
01:28:27,139 --> 01:28:28,140
I don't know what else...

1391
01:28:28,265 --> 01:28:31,143
I am security! Give me the suit!

1392
01:28:33,604 --> 01:28:35,229
Threes, threes, threes.

1393
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:36,815
- Arkady 3.0.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1394
01:28:48,911 --> 01:28:50,078
You're okay.

1395
01:28:58,253 --> 01:28:59,505
Shh.

1396
01:29:04,301 --> 01:29:06,594
<i>Nasha, she's the only one</i>

1397
01:29:06,595 --> 01:29:08,639
<i>who's always been there for me.</i>

1398
01:29:09,556 --> 01:29:11,391
<i>She's always loved me.</i>

1399
01:29:12,309 --> 01:29:13,393
<i>Every me.</i>

1400
01:29:14,436 --> 01:29:15,896
<i>Even him.</i>

1401
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:18,816
<i>The me I don't understand at all.</i>

1402
01:29:19,816 --> 01:29:20,649
What is this?

1403
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:22,067
Oh, you don't know about this.

1404
01:29:22,068 --> 01:29:23,819
They've been circling
the whole night.

1405
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:24,986
And still more coming in.

1406
01:29:24,987 --> 01:29:26,404
What are they doing?

1407
01:29:26,405 --> 01:29:29,407
We don't know. They can break
through solid ice and stone.

1408
01:29:29,408 --> 01:29:31,910
Imagine if they all come for this ship.
Terrifying.

1409
01:29:31,911 --> 01:29:33,495
But it couldn't even
tear through the sack

1410
01:29:33,496 --> 01:29:34,621
at the cafeteria.

1411
01:29:35,957 --> 01:29:38,709
You hear that? It's coming from
the one we captured yesterday.

1412
01:29:38,835 --> 01:29:39,876
Keep going, keep going.

1413
01:29:39,877 --> 01:29:41,461
Wait, what... You mean, the baby?

1414
01:29:41,462 --> 01:29:44,215
Well, yeah, it's been screaming
and crying like one.

1415
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,551
And that's when
they all started gathering.

1416
01:29:49,095 --> 01:29:49,762
Wait.

1417
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:52,597
- Hey.
- Mickey, don't stop.

1418
01:29:52,598 --> 01:29:54,766
That was...
That was the one that I...

1419
01:29:54,767 --> 01:29:55,809
Keep moving.

1420
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:56,894
Never mind.

1421
01:29:57,979 --> 01:30:00,355
Hi! How ya doing?

1422
01:30:00,356 --> 01:30:01,440
Excuse me.

1423
01:30:02,024 --> 01:30:03,109
Come on.

1424
01:30:03,442 --> 01:30:05,235
Sorry, passing through.

1425
01:30:05,236 --> 01:30:07,988
Hey. Why did they set up
the Situation Room there?

1426
01:30:07,989 --> 01:30:09,781
Beats me. I was just told
to bring the prisoner.

1427
01:30:09,782 --> 01:30:11,366
Apparently,
Ylfa made a big scene.

1428
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:13,243
She wants the creeper now.

1429
01:30:13,244 --> 01:30:14,744
Dorothy,
I have crucial information

1430
01:30:14,745 --> 01:30:15,829
about the creepers.

1431
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:18,040
Mickey needs to file an official
report with the head of Science.

1432
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:20,042
Oh, wait.

1433
01:30:29,552 --> 01:30:30,928
Yes. I knew it.

1434
01:30:31,262 --> 01:30:33,054
Yesterday, at the cafeteria,

1435
01:30:33,055 --> 01:30:35,432
when you held onto the baby,
I saw it.

1436
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:36,934
You saw that?

1437
01:30:37,894 --> 01:30:39,227
I don't know what it means, though.

1438
01:30:39,228 --> 01:30:41,229
Oh. So, you're just imitating.

1439
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:42,355
Well, originally, I...

1440
01:30:42,356 --> 01:30:43,857
Dorothy, look alive!

1441
01:30:43,858 --> 01:30:46,776
It's really hectic right now.
Let's talk later.

1442
01:30:46,777 --> 01:30:47,862
We're recording their sounds

1443
01:30:47,987 --> 01:30:50,156
to see if we can analyze
any kind of pattern.

1444
01:30:51,073 --> 01:30:53,617
<i>The Committee is declaring
a level three emergency.</i>

1445
01:30:53,618 --> 01:30:55,577
<i>Sole commanding control
has been granted</i>

1446
01:30:55,578 --> 01:30:57,454
<i>to Commander Marshall
by a vote of...</i>

1447
01:30:57,455 --> 01:30:58,581
<i>36 to 21.</i>

1448
01:31:01,876 --> 01:31:03,211
- Thank you.
- Oh.

1449
01:31:04,587 --> 01:31:07,672
What an event. This is
a truly novel ingredient.

1450
01:31:08,925 --> 01:31:11,718
This opens up a whole new world
of potential sauces.

1451
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:15,138
Mm. It's such a great...
How should I put it?

1452
01:31:15,139 --> 01:31:19,434
Opportunity, ma'am.
Yes, quite the opportunity. Just super.

1453
01:31:19,435 --> 01:31:22,062
Yes, it is a super opportunity.

1454
01:31:27,693 --> 01:31:29,737
Oh, wow.

1455
01:31:30,822 --> 01:31:32,907
It's such a godsend, too.

1456
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:36,576
It is free from
harmful pathogens, correct?

1457
01:31:36,577 --> 01:31:38,203
Yes, ma'am, sure.

1458
01:31:58,641 --> 01:32:00,685
Which dickhead is it? Mickey 18?

1459
01:32:01,978 --> 01:32:03,479
Keep his head still.

1460
01:32:08,025 --> 01:32:10,987
Now, I can tell you two apart.
Filthy Multiples.

1461
01:32:11,112 --> 01:32:13,655
Oh, yeah. That does seem fair.

1462
01:32:13,656 --> 01:32:15,532
Oh, goodness. Burnt meat.

1463
01:32:15,533 --> 01:32:17,200
Well, that's nothing, honey.

1464
01:32:17,201 --> 01:32:20,162
Wait until these two are
scorched sausages in the cycler.

1465
01:32:20,163 --> 01:32:21,705
How are you gonna handle
that stench?

1466
01:32:21,706 --> 01:32:22,790
I'm going as fast as I can.

1467
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:27,086
Mickey. I'm so sorry.

1468
01:32:27,795 --> 01:32:30,589
You two. This brick
stores your memories, right?

1469
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:31,548
Now, you'll watch

1470
01:32:31,549 --> 01:32:34,093
as I permanently
delete your being from it.

1471
01:32:34,552 --> 01:32:38,221
That way you'll understand the
meaning and terror of finality.

1472
01:32:38,222 --> 01:32:39,890
No more reprints!

1473
01:32:39,891 --> 01:32:42,392
That's what you both
should be thinking when you die.

1474
01:32:42,393 --> 01:32:43,728
Dead forever!

1475
01:32:44,854 --> 01:32:47,689
Now that the memory is gone,
which body goes first?

1476
01:32:47,690 --> 01:32:49,775
One at a time is twice the fun.

1477
01:32:50,234 --> 01:32:50,984
Creepy.

1478
01:32:50,985 --> 01:32:52,570
Commander Marshall, sir.

1479
01:32:53,446 --> 01:32:54,655
May I say a few words?

1480
01:32:55,114 --> 01:32:57,533
Regardless of who burns first,
a simple fact is,

1481
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:00,202
we currently have
two Mickeys here before us.

1482
01:33:00,203 --> 01:33:02,537
Due to no fault on their part,
I might add.

1483
01:33:02,538 --> 01:33:04,080
One of them
is being falsely accused

1484
01:33:04,081 --> 01:33:05,249
of firing his gun at you.

1485
01:33:05,374 --> 01:33:09,045
But the truth is, he was
concerned for your safety.

1486
01:33:10,546 --> 01:33:11,963
He was the first
to notice the second creeper

1487
01:33:11,964 --> 01:33:13,131
coming out of the stone
behind you,

1488
01:33:13,132 --> 01:33:14,883
and as you are well aware

1489
01:33:14,884 --> 01:33:16,051
the day an Expendable is printed...

1490
01:33:16,052 --> 01:33:16,969
Enough.

1491
01:33:17,303 --> 01:33:19,387
You defending these idiots.

1492
01:33:19,388 --> 01:33:21,348
Should be mopping up your own shit.

1493
01:33:21,349 --> 01:33:23,767
Illegal possession of Oxyzofol.

1494
01:33:23,768 --> 01:33:25,477
Concealment of a Multiples violation.

1495
01:33:25,478 --> 01:33:26,603
It's disappointing.

1496
01:33:26,604 --> 01:33:28,355
And attempted murder
with a fucking chain saw?

1497
01:33:29,357 --> 01:33:30,899
I mean, it's quite
the colorful rap sheet,

1498
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,068
don't you think, Miss. Barridge?

1499
01:33:32,193 --> 01:33:34,486
Mmm.
The clouds of war are billowing.

1500
01:33:34,487 --> 01:33:36,696
Look at those vermin swarm.

1501
01:33:36,697 --> 01:33:38,990
Mankind must unite
at this critical juncture.

1502
01:33:38,991 --> 01:33:42,410
Why are we wasting our time
with these dregs of society?

1503
01:33:42,411 --> 01:33:46,666
Spoken like a true wartime commander, sir.
Very impressive.

1504
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:48,375
And a fine entry

1505
01:33:48,376 --> 01:33:50,377
to add to your collection
of battle quotes, if I may.

1506
01:33:50,378 --> 01:33:51,628
- You like that?
- I do.

1507
01:33:51,629 --> 01:33:52,879
- More of that?
- Please.

1508
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,258
You keep mentioning that
we're in a state of war.

1509
01:33:56,551 --> 01:33:59,094
May I be so bold as to
offer two observations, sir?

1510
01:33:59,095 --> 01:34:01,096
Be my guest.

1511
01:34:01,097 --> 01:34:03,765
Firstly, fighting a war requires
a huge amount

1512
01:34:03,766 --> 01:34:05,476
of energy and calories.

1513
01:34:06,269 --> 01:34:08,270
Seeing as we're in
the early stages of settlement,

1514
01:34:08,271 --> 01:34:10,272
and our survival is in the balance,

1515
01:34:10,273 --> 01:34:12,732
I wonder whether
this expenditure is prudent.

1516
01:34:12,733 --> 01:34:16,027
Secondly, our apparent enemies
are the creepers.

1517
01:34:16,028 --> 01:34:19,865
But do we know whether they
actually want to engage in war?

1518
01:34:19,866 --> 01:34:22,826
For hours they've been swirling in circles
doing nothing but waiting.

1519
01:34:22,827 --> 01:34:25,745
My God, Agent Barridge.

1520
01:34:25,746 --> 01:34:30,877
You used to be a five time
Marshall Cup champion.

1521
01:34:31,002 --> 01:34:33,378
"Agent of the Month."

1522
01:34:33,379 --> 01:34:37,883
And now, you're sweating
over these alien insects?

1523
01:34:37,884 --> 01:34:40,887
How far you've fallen.

1524
01:34:41,512 --> 01:34:42,554
What are you gonna do

1525
01:34:42,555 --> 01:34:45,892
when they tear a hole in the ship
and tear off your ass?

1526
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:48,768
These grotesque shit-gibbons.

1527
01:34:48,769 --> 01:34:49,895
Grotesque or not,

1528
01:34:49,896 --> 01:34:52,397
they are the native inhabitants
of this planet.

1529
01:34:52,398 --> 01:34:55,025
And we have proof
that they saved one of us.

1530
01:34:55,026 --> 01:34:57,235
They didn't eat him or attack him.

1531
01:34:57,236 --> 01:34:58,862
Saved and not eaten whom?

1532
01:34:58,863 --> 01:35:01,574
Uh, me.

1533
01:35:02,825 --> 01:35:04,368
They saved me.

1534
01:35:09,665 --> 01:35:12,751
Of course they didn't eat you.
You're crap food.

1535
01:35:12,752 --> 01:35:15,253
You're recycled Spam baby.

1536
01:35:15,254 --> 01:35:18,965
You get chewed up and shit out
over and over and over again.

1537
01:35:18,966 --> 01:35:21,218
Well, I guess they aren't
just stupid bugs, honey.

1538
01:35:21,219 --> 01:35:23,554
I mean,
they knew to pass on crap, junk.

1539
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,680
They must have
some cognitive ability.

1540
01:35:25,681 --> 01:35:27,016
Exactly.

1541
01:35:27,683 --> 01:35:30,352
Actually, they exhibit signs
of high intelligence.

1542
01:35:30,353 --> 01:35:33,146
They may be able to engage
in meaningful conversation.

1543
01:35:33,147 --> 01:35:35,608
And we're analyzing this, and...

1544
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:41,238
Sir, you must try communicating
with them yourself.

1545
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:44,491
We're developing
a-a, um, a sort of translator.

1546
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:49,914
Like that, you mean?
You think I'm an idiot?

1547
01:35:50,498 --> 01:35:53,334
Uh.

1548
01:36:08,474 --> 01:36:12,102
Four and a half years
across the fucking galaxy,

1549
01:36:12,103 --> 01:36:16,189
just to hear
these goddamn aliens squawk?

1550
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:19,818
Tell me how the fuck
that makes any sense! Somebody!

1551
01:36:19,819 --> 01:36:21,362
How does this make any sense?

1552
01:36:22,196 --> 01:36:24,114
How does your bullshit
make any sense?

1553
01:36:24,115 --> 01:36:25,699
Your fucking fuckface

1554
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,450
is what really
doesn't make any fucking sense

1555
01:36:27,451 --> 01:36:29,287
you fucking idiot!

1556
01:36:30,413 --> 01:36:33,374
You call them aliens.
We're the aliens, dumbass.

1557
01:36:33,499 --> 01:36:35,918
They were living here before us,
and Mickey...

1558
01:36:36,919 --> 01:36:38,796
Mickey was always
just Mickey Barnes.

1559
01:36:39,755 --> 01:36:41,465
Do you even understand
what that means?

1560
01:36:41,466 --> 01:36:43,467
They were just living their lives.

1561
01:36:43,468 --> 01:36:46,845
Before you came in with your bullshit!

1562
01:36:46,846 --> 01:36:49,222
And you think you get to decide
who lives and who dies.

1563
01:36:49,223 --> 01:36:52,143
You are a dumb fuck!

1564
01:36:53,811 --> 01:36:55,145
No wonder you blew the elections,

1565
01:36:55,146 --> 01:36:57,023
you fucking moron.

1566
01:37:12,288 --> 01:37:15,333
No! No, no. No, stop!

1567
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:19,212
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're hurting a baby!

1568
01:37:28,554 --> 01:37:29,555
Bite.

1569
01:37:30,515 --> 01:37:31,682
What?

1570
01:37:32,183 --> 01:37:34,727
Falling in three, two, one.

1571
01:37:42,068 --> 01:37:44,486
Finally, she shut the fuck up.

1572
01:37:47,615 --> 01:37:50,743
This is clearly abuse,
one case after the other.

1573
01:37:52,286 --> 01:37:53,287
Rolling.

1574
01:37:55,873 --> 01:37:57,792
In 32K.

1575
01:37:59,377 --> 01:38:00,752
Make sure you get everything.

1576
01:38:00,753 --> 01:38:02,630
- Impressive teeth.
- Yeah.

1577
01:38:03,256 --> 01:38:05,340
We need more of our guys.

1578
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:10,220
Sir, now might be the prime time
to initiate Total Extermination.

1579
01:38:10,221 --> 01:38:12,722
The ones out there alone
would be more than enough.

1580
01:38:12,723 --> 01:38:14,224
What are you talking about?

1581
01:38:14,225 --> 01:38:16,351
We're gonna gas 'em,
we're gonna gas 'em all.

1582
01:38:18,855 --> 01:38:22,107
What's that look for? Still not
confident in your failures?

1583
01:38:22,108 --> 01:38:24,985
No. No. Sir, Arkady 3.0

1584
01:38:24,986 --> 01:38:27,237
has gone through several
meticulous stages of testing.

1585
01:38:27,238 --> 01:38:30,407
Arkady 3.0 is the ultimate nerve gas.

1586
01:38:30,408 --> 01:38:32,242
I have every confidence in it, sir.

1587
01:38:32,243 --> 01:38:34,870
As you should, Arkady.
This has to succeed.

1588
01:38:34,871 --> 01:38:36,622
I'll put it in my prayers.

1589
01:38:37,373 --> 01:38:39,750
This is the day
we've been waiting for, sir.

1590
01:38:39,876 --> 01:38:42,544
Future historians
will mark today as era-defining

1591
01:38:42,545 --> 01:38:44,964
for cleansing dangerous species
on colony planets.

1592
01:38:45,423 --> 01:38:48,008
Why don't you board
the flitter yourself later?

1593
01:38:48,009 --> 01:38:50,052
- You mean when we spray the gas?
- Yeah.

1594
01:38:51,053 --> 01:38:53,221
- I pull the trigger?
- Exactly, sir.

1595
01:38:53,222 --> 01:38:54,931
If you ride the lead flitter

1596
01:38:54,932 --> 01:38:57,934
and appear
to commandeer the operation,

1597
01:38:57,935 --> 01:39:00,979
the footage I get, it will be historic.

1598
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:03,356
And the members, the church
members back on Earth...

1599
01:39:03,357 --> 01:39:04,942
- Huh?
- They will adore.

1600
01:39:05,401 --> 01:39:07,235
Yes, yes, the company.

1601
01:39:07,236 --> 01:39:10,947
All right. It's time we initiate
Operation Total Extermination.

1602
01:39:10,948 --> 01:39:12,199
Honey, can I have a word with you?

1603
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,409
Yes, my love.

1604
01:39:14,494 --> 01:39:15,495
I've got an idea.

1605
01:39:18,956 --> 01:39:21,542
I hope you both can appreciate
what a great honor my wife

1606
01:39:21,667 --> 01:39:23,877
is bestowing on you shit stains.

1607
01:39:23,878 --> 01:39:27,255
And so I can press
both buttons simultaneously?

1608
01:39:27,256 --> 01:39:29,674
Yes, sir. Press them,
and they'll go off at the same time.

1609
01:39:29,675 --> 01:39:31,218
They'll also explode automatically

1610
01:39:31,219 --> 01:39:32,929
if they exit the range
of the remote control.

1611
01:39:33,262 --> 01:39:34,846
You hear that?
I have you by the balls,

1612
01:39:34,847 --> 01:39:36,223
so don't even think of running off.

1613
01:39:36,224 --> 01:39:38,308
You'll each be given a primitive
weapon as you head out.

1614
01:39:38,309 --> 01:39:40,393
You cut off as many
creeper tails as you can

1615
01:39:40,394 --> 01:39:43,897
and the first Mickey to bring
back 100 tails is the winner.

1616
01:39:43,898 --> 01:39:46,942
And the winner doesn't die,
but the loser goes...

1617
01:39:48,444 --> 01:39:49,361
- Boom!
- Boom!

1618
01:39:49,362 --> 01:39:50,112
Boom.

1619
01:39:50,863 --> 01:39:52,697
We'll keep score from here.

1620
01:39:52,698 --> 01:39:55,534
Your job is to make them
scream so loudly

1621
01:39:55,535 --> 01:39:58,703
that every last creeper
comes running in to save them.

1622
01:39:58,704 --> 01:40:00,832
We'll kill two birds
with one stone, right honey?

1623
01:40:00,957 --> 01:40:02,834
Absolutely.
A hundred tails is enough

1624
01:40:02,959 --> 01:40:04,709
to make enough sauce
to last a couple years.

1625
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:06,795
Better be on your toes.

1626
01:40:06,796 --> 01:40:09,632
One false move,
and you're man-burger.

1627
01:40:22,228 --> 01:40:23,896
I get it.

1628
01:40:25,148 --> 01:40:26,816
It's all punishment.

1629
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:29,652
What was that?

1630
01:40:31,779 --> 01:40:35,490
Our entire life's
a goddamn punishment.

1631
01:40:35,491 --> 01:40:38,202
All for pressing that button
when I was five.

1632
01:40:39,412 --> 01:40:43,291
Oh. This again!

1633
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:46,377
Accident was caused
by a car defect, you know that.

1634
01:40:47,336 --> 01:40:48,754
I don't know.

1635
01:40:53,342 --> 01:40:55,678
Well, it wasn't pressing
that stupid button.

1636
01:40:57,555 --> 01:41:00,640
It wasn't Mom's driving either.

1637
01:41:00,641 --> 01:41:02,560
How many times I gotta tell you?

1638
01:41:06,355 --> 01:41:10,650
Sorry, Mickey... Mickeys.
You need to move, like now.

1639
01:41:10,651 --> 01:41:12,194
Can you at least
put the ramp down?

1640
01:41:12,195 --> 01:41:14,112
We can't do that right now.
I'm sorry.

1641
01:41:14,113 --> 01:41:15,823
- You're gonna have to jump.
- Whoa!

1642
01:41:18,326 --> 01:41:19,660
Mickey!

1643
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:21,120
Mickey!

1644
01:41:21,913 --> 01:41:24,081
Wait, Mickey.

1645
01:41:25,875 --> 01:41:26,834
Take this.

1646
01:41:28,127 --> 01:41:29,461
It's not finished,
but it might help you

1647
01:41:29,462 --> 01:41:30,922
- communicate with the creepers.
- Let's go!

1648
01:41:31,506 --> 01:41:33,256
It's like a...
It's like a translator thing?

1649
01:41:33,257 --> 01:41:34,425
Yes. Good luck.

1650
01:41:34,967 --> 01:41:37,093
For what it's worth, I doubt
Marshall will kill both of you.

1651
01:41:37,094 --> 01:41:37,970
Come on.

1652
01:41:38,971 --> 01:41:39,639
Come.

1653
01:41:40,264 --> 01:41:43,267
- Let's go.
- Well, I...

1654
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:53,653
Uh, anyway, with this device,
I got a job to do.

1655
01:41:55,154 --> 01:41:59,158
All right. They saved me,
now I save them.

1656
01:41:59,784 --> 01:42:01,868
What are those fuckers doing?

1657
01:42:01,869 --> 01:42:05,037
Even I can count dozens of fresh
tails they're leaving behind.

1658
01:42:05,038 --> 01:42:06,665
Are they out of their minds?

1659
01:42:07,415 --> 01:42:09,166
Oh, honey.

1660
01:42:09,167 --> 01:42:12,295
- Should I just press the button?
- Mmm.

1661
01:42:12,838 --> 01:42:15,173
Let's sit back and watch.

1662
01:42:16,341 --> 01:42:18,300
They'll start chopping tails
as soon as they realize

1663
01:42:18,301 --> 01:42:21,053
one of them
has to outlive the other.

1664
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:23,515
Hey!

1665
01:42:24,808 --> 01:42:26,768
It's me! Wait!

1666
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:31,731
You gotta run away.
You gotta get them all outta here.

1667
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:33,984
You gotta go back to your cave.

1668
01:42:34,693 --> 01:42:37,862
Go back to your cave.

1669
01:42:41,241 --> 01:42:43,075
Or you're all gonna die.

1670
01:42:45,162 --> 01:42:46,163
<i>What?</i>

1671
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:47,581
Oh, hello.

1672
01:42:49,499 --> 01:42:50,584
Um...

1673
01:42:51,418 --> 01:42:54,963
Yes, I just, I wanted...
About last time, I...

1674
01:42:57,757 --> 01:43:00,676
I wanted to say thank you.

1675
01:43:00,677 --> 01:43:02,137
Um...

1676
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:05,265
You remember me, right?

1677
01:43:07,225 --> 01:43:08,560
<i>Mickey.</i>

1678
01:43:11,396 --> 01:43:13,190
How do you know my name?

1679
01:43:16,151 --> 01:43:17,611
<i>Secret.</i>

1680
01:43:18,653 --> 01:43:20,864
Wait, are they
having a conversation?

1681
01:43:22,199 --> 01:43:25,201
Yes. We already explained it just now.

1682
01:43:25,202 --> 01:43:26,911
How is this possible?

1683
01:43:26,912 --> 01:43:29,581
Well, it's still a prototype,

1684
01:43:29,706 --> 01:43:32,750
but it's like a translator device.

1685
01:43:32,751 --> 01:43:35,878
Dorothy? Oh, no.
Where's Dorothy?

1686
01:43:35,879 --> 01:43:38,547
I can't hear a thing with all this static.

1687
01:43:38,548 --> 01:43:40,550
I mean, even the video is shit.

1688
01:43:41,218 --> 01:43:44,470
Apologies, sir. The snowstorm
is exacerbating the absorption...

1689
01:43:44,471 --> 01:43:47,097
What about this?
Will this detonator work?

1690
01:43:47,098 --> 01:43:49,266
Yes, sir. That is a special
shortwave signal,

1691
01:43:49,267 --> 01:43:50,184
so it'll be fine.

1692
01:43:50,185 --> 01:43:52,645
And who's that big one there?

1693
01:43:52,646 --> 01:43:53,854
Is that the queen bee of the bunch?

1694
01:43:53,855 --> 01:43:56,649
Mmm. Looks like a croissant
dipped in shit.

1695
01:43:56,650 --> 01:44:00,736
Uh, official reports
are still being finalized,

1696
01:44:00,737 --> 01:44:03,781
but we think everything revolves
around that one,

1697
01:44:03,782 --> 01:44:05,450
the Mama Creeper.

1698
01:44:05,575 --> 01:44:07,911
So, that one's the boss.
Like you.

1699
01:44:09,996 --> 01:44:11,540
<i>Say what?</i>

1700
01:44:11,665 --> 01:44:13,833
You gotta get outta here,

1701
01:44:13,834 --> 01:44:16,503
or they're gonna kill you
all with this death gas.

1702
01:44:17,712 --> 01:44:22,174
That gas, Arkady 3.0,
I got blasted with that.

1703
01:44:22,175 --> 01:44:25,345
It's seriously, insanely painful.

1704
01:44:27,305 --> 01:44:30,809
Do you know what gas is?
Gas. Like...

1705
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:34,146
Like gas?

1706
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,151
<i>Mind your own business, stupid.</i>

1707
01:44:40,152 --> 01:44:43,655
Mind my own business?
What about you?

1708
01:44:44,656 --> 01:44:46,700
Why'd you save him at the cave?

1709
01:44:49,536 --> 01:44:51,371
<i>Should kill him?</i>

1710
01:44:51,788 --> 01:44:53,707
No. No.

1711
01:44:54,791 --> 01:44:58,295
I'm... We're very grateful.
That's all.

1712
01:44:59,045 --> 01:45:00,297
<i>Then why?</i>

1713
01:45:03,175 --> 01:45:04,676
<i>Why kill Luco?</i>

1714
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,305
Uh, Luco?

1715
01:45:10,557 --> 01:45:12,893
<i>Baby Luco.</i>

1716
01:45:14,269 --> 01:45:15,270
Oh.

1717
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:21,234
<i>You group. Shattered.</i>

1718
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:23,360
<i>Blood.</i>

1719
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:24,613
Yeah...

1720
01:45:25,155 --> 01:45:26,198
Oh, that's...

1721
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:28,200
That's Luco.

1722
01:45:30,327 --> 01:45:32,120
<i>We save you.</i>

1723
01:45:34,706 --> 01:45:38,084
<i>You kill Luco.</i>

1724
01:45:42,714 --> 01:45:45,592
So, what's the name of the other baby?
The one in the ship.

1725
01:45:46,468 --> 01:45:48,887
<i>Zoco.</i>

1726
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:53,225
<i>Kill Zoco too?</i>

1727
01:45:53,725 --> 01:45:57,896
What if Zoco dies?
What will you do?

1728
01:46:00,315 --> 01:46:01,650
<i>Death.</i>

1729
01:46:02,317 --> 01:46:03,693
<i>All.</i>

1730
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:08,990
You mean all humans.

1731
01:46:13,078 --> 01:46:15,580
<i>- Extinction.</i>
- How?

1732
01:46:16,915 --> 01:46:19,501
<i>Easy.</i>

1733
01:47:01,209 --> 01:47:05,171
<i>Cover your ear.</i>

1734
01:47:05,172 --> 01:47:08,216
<i>But eyeball explode.</i>

1735
01:47:11,261 --> 01:47:13,138
<i>Brain explode.</i>

1736
01:47:15,724 --> 01:47:17,183
<i>All of you.</i>

1737
01:47:24,316 --> 01:47:25,525
Nasha!

1738
01:47:26,276 --> 01:47:27,277
Nasha!

1739
01:47:33,992 --> 01:47:35,202
Nasha!

1740
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,913
Nasha! Look at me!

1741
01:47:39,289 --> 01:47:40,540
Look at my mouth.

1742
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:45,836
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with him?

1743
01:47:45,837 --> 01:47:48,923
And they're saying something.
What is that idiot saying?

1744
01:47:48,924 --> 01:47:51,176
It's not sign language.

1745
01:47:51,593 --> 01:47:53,136
C3!

1746
01:47:53,678 --> 01:47:55,096
C3!

1747
01:47:59,309 --> 01:48:01,644
C... 3?

1748
01:48:01,645 --> 01:48:02,978
3?

1749
01:48:02,979 --> 01:48:05,315
C3? What's C3?

1750
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,440
C3?

1751
01:48:14,741 --> 01:48:15,533
Bring the baby.

1752
01:48:15,534 --> 01:48:17,035
<i>Bring the baby.</i>

1753
01:48:17,452 --> 01:48:19,787
Bring the baby.

1754
01:48:19,788 --> 01:48:21,581
<i>If we don't bring her back,</i>

1755
01:48:22,290 --> 01:48:24,041
<i>we're all gonna die.</i>

1756
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:25,668
Honey, this doesn't sit well with me.

1757
01:48:25,669 --> 01:48:27,461
Why are those two losers chatting

1758
01:48:27,462 --> 01:48:28,587
with the boss of the bugs?

1759
01:48:28,588 --> 01:48:29,922
They think they're negotiating

1760
01:48:29,923 --> 01:48:31,674
on behalf of mankind...
humankind?

1761
01:48:31,675 --> 01:48:34,009
You should be standing out there, sir,

1762
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:36,471
ushering in this historic moment.

1763
01:48:37,305 --> 01:48:39,974
You're seeing two bosses meeting

1764
01:48:39,975 --> 01:48:42,643
face to face
in a climactic snowstorm?

1765
01:48:42,644 --> 01:48:43,894
A moment of destiny?

1766
01:48:43,895 --> 01:48:45,938
All you have to do
is go out there.

1767
01:48:45,939 --> 01:48:47,857
I know I can create an iconic scene.

1768
01:48:47,858 --> 01:48:51,235
A decisive moment in the history
of the Niflheim settlement.

1769
01:48:51,236 --> 01:48:53,363
- Bring the baby.
- I can picture it now.

1770
01:48:53,488 --> 01:48:56,657
Adorning the ceiling and
the walls of the grand chapel.

1771
01:48:56,658 --> 01:48:58,535
Yes, ma'am, yes.

1772
01:48:59,244 --> 01:49:01,579
And one final touch, sir.

1773
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:03,790
I think it would be great
if you give them a message

1774
01:49:03,915 --> 01:49:05,458
before spraying the gas.

1775
01:49:05,459 --> 01:49:06,543
A message?

1776
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,962
Without such poignancy, today
would be a third-rate carnival

1777
01:49:09,963 --> 01:49:13,382
where we spray cheap pesticide
over cockroaches.

1778
01:49:13,383 --> 01:49:17,261
Yes, they are disgusting,
filthy, evil insects,

1779
01:49:17,262 --> 01:49:19,138
but it will be their last moment,

1780
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:21,724
and you could offer them
a few merciful words

1781
01:49:21,725 --> 01:49:26,354
as a proper farewell,
like a wise, benevolent priest.

1782
01:49:26,646 --> 01:49:28,022
Get me a camera crew.

1783
01:49:28,023 --> 01:49:29,732
Tell the first squad
to meet me fully armed.

1784
01:49:29,733 --> 01:49:30,566
Yes, sir.

1785
01:49:30,567 --> 01:49:33,904
My love, the Situation Room
is yours. Till we meet again.

1786
01:49:38,617 --> 01:49:41,202
C3. Nasha will know
what it means.

1787
01:49:41,203 --> 01:49:42,579
It's a whole thing.

1788
01:49:43,538 --> 01:49:46,458
I'm gonna get Zoco back safe.
I mean it.

1789
01:49:48,752 --> 01:49:50,086
<i>Not enough.</i>

1790
01:49:51,588 --> 01:49:53,047
What else?

1791
01:49:54,466 --> 01:49:56,383
<i>We lose Luco.</i>

1792
01:49:57,719 --> 01:49:58,844
<i>One.</i>

1793
01:49:58,845 --> 01:50:01,181
<i>Be fair.</i>

1794
01:50:02,224 --> 01:50:05,477
Be fair? Like we have
to contribute a death?

1795
01:50:06,895 --> 01:50:07,938
<i>Yes.</i>

1796
01:50:09,105 --> 01:50:10,273
<i>Fair.</i>

1797
01:50:11,149 --> 01:50:14,485
<i>One of yours. Die.</i>

1798
01:50:14,486 --> 01:50:18,197
So, if we bring back Zoco safe,
and a human dies...

1799
01:50:18,198 --> 01:50:21,326
<i>Peace.</i>

1800
01:50:36,633 --> 01:50:37,551
Drive.

1801
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,940
You hear me?

1802
01:50:52,941 --> 01:50:55,235
Camera crew, unit three,
do you copy?

1803
01:50:56,069 --> 01:50:58,571
Okay, the radio signal's
a little patchy right now,

1804
01:50:58,572 --> 01:51:01,323
so the car speaker will be
our direct line of comms.

1805
01:51:01,324 --> 01:51:03,326
Unit two, do you copy?

1806
01:51:03,702 --> 01:51:07,163
Our orders are to safely escort
Commander Marshall...

1807
01:51:07,164 --> 01:51:12,836
No one told you to shoot!
Do not agitate the creepers!

1808
01:51:13,503 --> 01:51:16,465
Pipe down.
We're not here to film you.

1809
01:51:22,053 --> 01:51:23,262
Really great.

1810
01:51:23,263 --> 01:51:25,347
Okay, right after your speech, sir,

1811
01:51:25,348 --> 01:51:27,141
we'll close the canopy at once,

1812
01:51:27,142 --> 01:51:30,769
and that'll be the signal for
the air squad to spray that gas.

1813
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:33,106
Glorious annihilation, sir.

1814
01:51:35,734 --> 01:51:37,860
You. Yes, you. Come here,
what's your name? Matthew?

1815
01:51:37,861 --> 01:51:41,822
Oh, Matthew, you have the face
of an angel. Here, try my sauce.

1816
01:51:41,823 --> 01:51:44,074
There you go.
Tell me what you think.

1817
01:51:44,075 --> 01:51:45,201
Oh! Nasha!

1818
01:51:46,411 --> 01:51:48,580
No! No! Stop!

1819
01:51:49,122 --> 01:51:52,083
Hold! She's primed
for spinal fracture.

1820
01:51:52,209 --> 01:51:55,419
I'm gonna break this bitch's neck.

1821
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:58,381
No, no, no.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1822
01:52:00,383 --> 01:52:02,009
One snap and it's instant death.

1823
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,807
Nasha Barridge,
what do you want?

1824
01:52:07,724 --> 01:52:11,686
The baby. We have to
take it to the mama.

1825
01:52:12,187 --> 01:52:13,814
- That's all?
- Yes.

1826
01:52:14,272 --> 01:52:15,774
Guarantee us a safe exit.

1827
01:52:16,525 --> 01:52:18,692
Unless you wanna
see me break her neck.

1828
01:52:19,986 --> 01:52:22,363
No. Nasha, please don't.

1829
01:52:22,364 --> 01:52:25,491
Look, we secure Nasha's exit,
as negotiated.

1830
01:52:25,492 --> 01:52:27,744
Nasha, can you release her carefully?

1831
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,082
I'm gonna get the baby.
Be careful.

1832
01:52:32,624 --> 01:52:33,457
Nasha, are you okay?

1833
01:52:33,458 --> 01:52:35,501
I need to hurry.
Can I get a flitter?

1834
01:52:35,502 --> 01:52:37,462
I doubt it. You'll have to run.

1835
01:52:46,721 --> 01:52:48,305
Arrest that fucking bitch!

1836
01:52:48,306 --> 01:52:50,766
Ma'am, today you
and the commander have displayed

1837
01:52:50,767 --> 01:52:52,143
an impressive range of verbal

1838
01:52:52,144 --> 01:52:54,395
and physical abuse
and acts of cruelty

1839
01:52:54,396 --> 01:52:55,938
that far exceed
your granted authority.

1840
01:52:55,939 --> 01:52:58,608
You wanna be executed
for mutiny?

1841
01:52:58,733 --> 01:53:00,359
All video evidence of abuse

1842
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:02,612
will be presented to the
Committee for review.

1843
01:53:02,737 --> 01:53:05,322
I suggest you have answers
prepared for your hearing.

1844
01:53:05,323 --> 01:53:07,284
Thanks, Zeke.

1845
01:53:08,118 --> 01:53:09,911
Maintain control onsite.

1846
01:53:19,045 --> 01:53:21,881
When we're within 100 feet
of the Mama Creeper, sir,

1847
01:53:21,882 --> 01:53:24,800
we'll start
slowly circling the creature.

1848
01:53:24,801 --> 01:53:26,969
That'll be the cue
to begin your final speech.

1849
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:27,720
Yes.

1850
01:53:27,721 --> 01:53:30,640
The other camera will track
alongside you from the outside,

1851
01:53:30,765 --> 01:53:34,019
making the scene
absolutely spectacular, sir.

1852
01:53:35,562 --> 01:53:38,482
I'll keep my speech
short and tight.

1853
01:53:39,149 --> 01:53:42,235
A marvelous address.
No need to edit.

1854
01:53:42,861 --> 01:53:44,987
And then I blow up the Mickeys.

1855
01:53:44,988 --> 01:53:46,280
<i>Un bouquet final.</i>

1856
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:47,865
You can do this, Nasha.

1857
01:53:47,866 --> 01:53:49,158
We'll get things
under control inside.

1858
01:53:49,159 --> 01:53:50,202
- Open the gate.
- Okay.

1859
01:53:51,369 --> 01:53:52,829
- See ya.
- Good luck!

1860
01:53:59,961 --> 01:54:01,587
Nasha's gonna
figure this all out.

1861
01:54:01,588 --> 01:54:03,256
Zoco will be back safe.

1862
01:54:04,341 --> 01:54:05,425
Who is that?

1863
01:54:06,384 --> 01:54:07,427
Who's coming?

1864
01:54:11,807 --> 01:54:13,016
Oh, shit.

1865
01:54:39,668 --> 01:54:40,961
Wow.

1866
01:54:44,089 --> 01:54:44,756
Wait.

1867
01:54:45,715 --> 01:54:47,300
What is this bullshit?

1868
01:54:49,553 --> 01:54:51,345
Which one's the mama?

1869
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,889
What the fuck
am I supposed to be looking at

1870
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:56,684
when I make my speech?

1871
01:54:58,769 --> 01:55:01,105
I was gonna send them off
with some dignity.

1872
01:55:01,981 --> 01:55:04,441
Now those barbarians can fuck off!

1873
01:55:05,901 --> 01:55:08,529
- Is that bazooka ready?
- Yes, sir. Loading now.

1874
01:55:09,155 --> 01:55:11,824
We're gonna blast
that mama bitch into oblivion.

1875
01:55:12,241 --> 01:55:13,993
Who needs a fucking speech?

1876
01:55:15,494 --> 01:55:17,162
I'll go hard, honey.

1877
01:55:17,163 --> 01:55:19,457
That's the mama there, sir,
can you see it?

1878
01:55:19,582 --> 01:55:21,416
It has a different shape.

1879
01:55:21,417 --> 01:55:23,377
Yes, it's her. Aim!

1880
01:55:25,463 --> 01:55:27,422
It's not her, dumbass!

1881
01:55:27,423 --> 01:55:28,423
Sorry, sir.

1882
01:55:34,805 --> 01:55:36,223
Mickey!

1883
01:55:37,516 --> 01:55:40,311
Nasha! Nasha!

1884
01:55:45,691 --> 01:55:46,858
Mickey?

1885
01:56:08,214 --> 01:56:09,590
Time to say goodbye.

1886
01:56:10,633 --> 01:56:11,759
What?

1887
01:56:23,312 --> 01:56:25,940
Blast at the nearest pile!

1888
01:56:26,315 --> 01:56:30,235
Tear through them all until
we get to the mama. Smash them!

1889
01:56:30,236 --> 01:56:33,488
Camera, make sure
to get the blood and guts.

1890
01:56:33,489 --> 01:56:36,033
Wait. That one there.

1891
01:56:36,617 --> 01:56:38,535
Shoot that one first.
It's bigger.

1892
01:56:38,536 --> 01:56:39,661
Fire!

1893
01:56:39,662 --> 01:56:40,995
- Fire now!
- Yes, sir.

1894
01:56:45,126 --> 01:56:46,085
Fire!

1895
01:56:47,086 --> 01:56:48,419
No, sir, the bomb vest!

1896
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,088
Head shot, you fucking idiot!

1897
01:56:50,089 --> 01:56:51,923
No! No, sir. It's too close!

1898
01:56:55,094 --> 01:56:58,806
Wait, sir! Stop, wait!

1899
01:57:01,642 --> 01:57:04,728
No, where... Oh, my God.

1900
01:57:05,396 --> 01:57:06,689
Mickey!

1901
01:57:07,898 --> 01:57:10,483
Nasha! Hey!

1902
01:57:10,484 --> 01:57:13,236
I knew you would make it.
Is the baby okay?

1903
01:57:14,697 --> 01:57:15,948
No, no, no.

1904
01:57:16,949 --> 01:57:18,159
What's going on?

1905
01:57:18,993 --> 01:57:20,035
Look!

1906
01:57:21,704 --> 01:57:24,373
We have Zoco!
Nasha brought her back.

1907
01:57:24,498 --> 01:57:25,583
Look.

1908
01:57:32,631 --> 01:57:34,300
Uh, Nasha,

1909
01:57:35,426 --> 01:57:37,178
Zoco's okay, right?

1910
01:57:37,761 --> 01:57:39,096
Hey!

1911
01:57:40,055 --> 01:57:41,265
Are you seeing this?

1912
01:57:43,934 --> 01:57:47,146
One human!

1913
01:58:08,083 --> 01:58:09,794
You're also afraid.

1914
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:14,131
We're both afraid.

1915
01:58:15,257 --> 01:58:18,843
Yeah, I'm afraid.

1916
01:58:18,844 --> 01:58:20,513
It means you're human.

1917
01:58:22,431 --> 01:58:23,682
You're important.

1918
01:58:25,267 --> 01:58:27,144
Come to me, my boy.

1919
01:59:19,363 --> 01:59:20,489
{\an8} <i>Okay, guys...</i>

1920
01:59:20,906 --> 01:59:25,493
Guys, don't be shy. If you could
sit down. Take your seats.

1921
01:59:25,494 --> 01:59:28,121
The groundbreaking ceremony
will come later,

1922
01:59:28,122 --> 01:59:30,290
but we'll start
with the Expendable stuff.

1923
01:59:30,291 --> 01:59:33,418
Mickey. Mickey,
come up to the front, mate.

1924
01:59:33,419 --> 01:59:37,173
Could someone please sit in the front row,
you fucking introverts?

1925
01:59:43,846 --> 01:59:45,555
Hello, everyone.

1926
01:59:45,556 --> 01:59:47,932
I'm Nasha Barridge,
member of the Committee.

1927
01:59:50,769 --> 01:59:51,936
After weeks of debate,

1928
01:59:51,937 --> 01:59:54,523
we have finally come
to this momentous day.

1929
01:59:55,191 --> 01:59:57,693
The day we abolish
the Expendables program.

1930
01:59:58,110 --> 02:00:00,111
I would like to thank
my fellow Committee members

1931
02:00:00,112 --> 02:00:01,070
for their support.

1932
02:00:01,071 --> 02:00:03,698
I've been really feeling the love.

1933
02:00:03,699 --> 02:00:07,076
And especially,
for fighting right to the end,

1934
02:00:07,077 --> 02:00:09,038
and persuading the Committee

1935
02:00:09,163 --> 02:00:11,165
to permanently
abolish human printing...

1936
02:00:12,082 --> 02:00:15,502
I would like to thank
our very own Mickey Barnes.

1937
02:00:17,338 --> 02:00:19,589
And to be fair,
I'm just so fucking happy

1938
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:20,924
I get to grow old with Mickey.

1939
02:00:20,925 --> 02:00:23,927
It was really sucking
getting old by myself. Okay.

1940
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:27,013
Despite the hours of
peaceful discussion...

1941
02:00:27,014 --> 02:00:28,098
All right.

1942
02:00:29,433 --> 02:00:30,433
So, you hit the button.

1943
02:00:30,434 --> 02:00:31,560
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait.

1944
02:00:32,645 --> 02:00:35,104
Nasha will give the signal.
You hit the button.

1945
02:00:35,105 --> 02:00:37,566
Wait. And then over there, boom.

1946
02:00:38,275 --> 02:00:41,111
Do I get up and press it or...
No, in my seat, right?

1947
02:00:41,237 --> 02:00:43,405
I honestly couldn't give a fuck.

1948
02:00:45,366 --> 02:00:48,326
Henceforth,
on Niflheim as on Earth,

1949
02:00:48,327 --> 02:00:51,580
human printing is now
permanently abolished.

1950
02:00:54,875 --> 02:00:59,254
Here today, the human printer
will be burnt to ashes

1951
02:00:59,255 --> 02:01:00,840
and erased from memory.

1952
02:01:01,632 --> 02:01:03,216
<i>Nasha's such a natural.</i>

1953
02:01:03,217 --> 02:01:06,719
<i>I think she could even run for
Committee chair next election.</i>

1954
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:09,222
<i>Blows my mind still to think
that this amazing woman</i>

1955
02:01:09,223 --> 02:01:12,016
<i>just six months ago was rotting
with the rest of us</i>

1956
02:01:12,017 --> 02:01:13,601
<i>in that shitty prison.</i>

1957
02:01:16,147 --> 02:01:18,398
<i>The day
Marshall got blown to dust,</i>

1958
02:01:18,399 --> 02:01:21,318
<i>Ylfa went into shock
and was taken to the psych ward.</i>

1959
02:01:21,735 --> 02:01:24,946
<i>Rumors went around
that she slit her wrists there.</i>

1960
02:01:24,947 --> 02:01:27,574
<i>Everyone else involved
was shoved into jail.</i>

1961
02:01:27,575 --> 02:01:30,327
<i>And somehow lucky Timo
squeezes out on parole.</i>

1962
02:01:32,246 --> 02:01:33,497
<i>But as soon as he got out,</i>

1963
02:01:33,622 --> 02:01:35,039
<i>he spent every day
dreading the moment</i>

1964
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,249
<i>he'd come face to face</i>

1965
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:37,960
<i>with the man
who delivered the letter.</i>

1966
02:01:38,669 --> 02:01:43,340
<i>The associate of Darius Blank,
who one day finally jumped him.</i>

1967
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,429
<i>It was a fight to the death.</i>

1968
02:01:49,472 --> 02:01:50,639
<i>In the end,</i>

1969
02:01:51,348 --> 02:01:54,351
<i>the associate
became, uh, cycler soup.</i>

1970
02:01:57,062 --> 02:01:58,731
<i>Except for one ear.</i>

1971
02:02:00,649 --> 02:02:04,360
<i>Even at the trial,
Timo chooses to represent himself.</i>

1972
02:02:05,821 --> 02:02:08,114
As he had his grip on me,
he brought his knife around

1973
02:02:08,115 --> 02:02:10,700
to my mid-section right here,
and he sliced...

1974
02:02:10,701 --> 02:02:13,995
<i>And he got
released on self-defense.</i>

1975
02:02:13,996 --> 02:02:15,498
<i>Classic Timo.</i>

1976
02:02:16,123 --> 02:02:19,000
<i>But our trials on the other
hand, were never-ending.</i>

1977
02:02:19,001 --> 02:02:21,461
Damien, sit down! Sit down!

1978
02:02:21,462 --> 02:02:25,131
<i>Became a whole political fight
between all the pro-Marshalls</i>

1979
02:02:25,132 --> 02:02:27,717
<i>and the anti-Marshalls.</i>

1980
02:02:27,718 --> 02:02:30,553
<i>But by then,
Nasha had made up her mind.</i>

1981
02:02:30,554 --> 02:02:33,807
<i>She'd overhaul the Committee,
and change it herself.</i>

1982
02:02:33,808 --> 02:02:37,478
<i>So after she got out, she really
did run in the election.</i>

1983
02:02:38,437 --> 02:02:40,689
<i>And she won in a landslide.</i>

1984
02:02:42,024 --> 02:02:44,025
<i>On her first day in the assembly,</i>

1985
02:02:44,026 --> 02:02:46,737
<i>Nasha was so cool
about the whole thing.</i>

1986
02:02:48,781 --> 02:02:51,367
<i>I was very, very nervous.</i>

1987
02:02:51,867 --> 02:02:53,869
<i>I don't think
she really noticed, though.</i>

1988
02:02:55,871 --> 02:02:59,959
Mickey. I've got the upgraded translator.
Just came out.

1989
02:03:03,546 --> 02:03:06,005
Okay, let's be fair,
can I ask you a question?

1990
02:03:07,967 --> 02:03:08,884
<i>Go.</i>

1991
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:11,095
What you said before,

1992
02:03:11,595 --> 02:03:15,557
about extinction and all that,
when you were all like...

1993
02:03:17,935 --> 02:03:20,354
and like screeching
and everything.

1994
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:22,231
Mmm.

1995
02:03:23,816 --> 02:03:27,443
Would that really
make our brains explode?

1996
02:03:27,444 --> 02:03:29,488
From like the pitch?

1997
02:03:31,907 --> 02:03:33,449
<i>Explode.</i>

1998
02:03:33,450 --> 02:03:35,077
But you said...

1999
02:03:35,494 --> 02:03:39,665
that our eyeballs would explode.

2000
02:03:40,499 --> 02:03:43,461
Mmm. Why not our eardrums?

2001
02:03:43,961 --> 02:03:46,255
'Cause it's like sound.

2002
02:03:49,049 --> 02:03:51,009
<i>All explode.</i>

2003
02:03:51,010 --> 02:03:52,928
Really?

2004
02:03:53,596 --> 02:03:56,432
Well, can you try it right here?
Right now?

2005
02:04:13,491 --> 02:04:15,910
<i>Who said
bluffing was only for humans?</i>

2006
02:04:16,452 --> 02:04:18,996
<i>Gotta love that, uh, poker face.</i>

2007
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:22,666
<i>Yeah and nice burp, too.</i>

2008
02:05:28,065 --> 02:05:29,859
Uh, hello.

2009
02:05:30,484 --> 02:05:33,862
What are you doing here?
In the middle of the night.

2010
02:05:33,863 --> 02:05:37,365
Well, I just...

2011
02:05:37,366 --> 02:05:39,325
I thought you were
in the hospital all this time.

2012
02:05:39,326 --> 02:05:41,077
Hey, watch it. Look down.

2013
02:05:41,078 --> 02:05:43,205
Don't step on it.

2014
02:05:46,167 --> 02:05:49,043
It's a priceless delicacy, that.

2015
02:05:49,044 --> 02:05:51,296
Go on. Take a dab.

2016
02:05:51,297 --> 02:05:52,882
Have a taste.

2017
02:05:55,926 --> 02:05:58,887
Oh, what? Now you're too good
for sauce off the floor?

2018
02:05:58,888 --> 02:06:00,805
You think anyone else
would allow scum like you

2019
02:06:00,806 --> 02:06:02,308
to taste something so refined?

2020
02:06:03,267 --> 02:06:05,977
What is... What is it made of?

2021
02:06:05,978 --> 02:06:09,147
Rude! Not how it works.

2022
02:06:09,148 --> 02:06:13,276
A taste of faith comes first,
then I tell you what's in it.

2023
02:06:13,277 --> 02:06:15,028
Mickey, you don't think
I'm letting you taste this

2024
02:06:15,029 --> 02:06:18,072
out of some high regard
for your palate, do you?

2025
02:06:18,073 --> 02:06:19,908
It's the opposite.

2026
02:06:19,909 --> 02:06:22,076
A true masterpiece
would be a sauce

2027
02:06:22,077 --> 02:06:25,122
that could appeal to even
an ignorant cretin like you.

2028
02:06:33,589 --> 02:06:34,881
Whatever. Fuck it.

2029
02:06:34,882 --> 02:06:36,591
Taste it, waste it, I don't care.

2030
02:06:36,592 --> 02:06:37,926
You're worthless now.

2031
02:06:37,927 --> 02:06:41,012
Much better to bring back
my usual taster,

2032
02:06:41,013 --> 02:06:44,724
the supreme one
with an actually refined palate.

2033
02:06:46,977 --> 02:06:49,146
Wait, that's...

2034
02:06:50,648 --> 02:06:53,692
Even his kidneys
are more handsome than you.

2035
02:06:57,363 --> 02:06:59,989
Not this. It can't be.

2036
02:07:03,911 --> 02:07:05,371
Of course it can.

2037
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:08,624
Admit it, it's what you want.

2038
02:07:08,749 --> 02:07:12,378
It's what everyone wants.

2039
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:15,005
Hey Ylfa.

2040
02:07:16,757 --> 02:07:18,676
I just remembered.

2041
02:07:21,762 --> 02:07:25,474
You died the day after Marshall.

2042
02:07:44,409 --> 02:07:47,162
Go ahead, touch me.

2043
02:07:48,872 --> 02:07:51,708
See if I'm ghost or human.

2044
02:07:56,296 --> 02:08:00,841
<i>Ever since I was a kid,
I've had scary dreams.</i>

2045
02:08:00,842 --> 02:08:03,261
<i>This time I wasn't scared.</i>

2046
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:05,472
<i>I just thought to myself,</i>

2047
02:08:06,097 --> 02:08:07,974
<i>"What would 18 do?"</i>

2048
02:08:09,392 --> 02:08:10,726
Fuck off.

2049
02:08:12,061 --> 02:08:13,812
What are you doing?
Press the button.

2050
02:08:13,813 --> 02:08:15,940
Mickey. Press it.

2051
02:08:17,358 --> 02:08:18,401
Do it.
