00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:02,530
Hello. Bonjour.

2
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:05,158
Guten Tag. Hujambo. Hola.

3
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,118
Congratulations on your purchase

4
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,454
of a Universal Dynamics robot.

5
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:12,457
I am Rozzum 7134.

6
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:15,293
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

7
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,878
Just ask.

8
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:22,675
Just ask.

9
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:36,981
Processing.

10
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,854
Do you need...

11
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,898
assistance?

12
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:35,790
Ready to receive my first task.

13
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:07,572
Rozzum 7134 is available
for task assignment.

14
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,076
Rozzum robots come standard
with the Alpha-113

15
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,078
dimensional processor.

16
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,914
If you're unsure
about how I can assist,

17
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,625
try asking me about myself.

18
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:28,593
Excuse me.

19
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:31,512
Did you know I can assist
with grocery shopping?

20
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,055
Banking?

21
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,517
Landscaping?

22
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:45,568
Hello. Did you perhaps order
a Rozzum helper robot?

23
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,612
Is that a no?

24
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,197
Here's a free sticker.

25
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:52,492
Scan the code and receive
ten percent off of your...

26
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,633
Do you need assistance?

27
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:11,052
I see your problem.

28
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,070
Rozzums are programmed
for instant physical mimicry,

29
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,696
so as to...

30
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,058
Aggression detected.

31
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,644
My communication package
includes

32
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:04,772
strategies
for conflict resolution.

33
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:10,611
Your dialect is not
in my data banks.

34
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,364
Tell your people not to worry.

35
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:18,327
Rozzum 7134 will sort out this
language barrier in no time.

36
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,835
Activating learning mode.

37
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:47,857
- I say...
- Hey, check it out.

38
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,900
Look, look, look.
Somebody died over here.

39
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,652
Let me see. Let me see. Oh!

40
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:52,903
- Who was it?
- Anybody we know?

41
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,614
Fresh or not fresh?

42
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:55,823
Smells pretty good.

43
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:57,241
Tastes terrible!

44
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,743
- Oh, it's waking up.
- Hey, it's waking up.

45
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,289
- It's a monster!
- Run for your lives!

46
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:06,083
Look, that's the thing
that destroyed my dam.

47
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,127
- The monster.
- Yikes!

48
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:09,795
I think it's gonna talk.

49
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:11,589
Thank you for your patience

50
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,175
while I deciphered
your language.

51
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:18,429
I am Rozzum 7134,
ready to enhance your lives

52
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,099
with integrated multiphase
task accomplishment.

53
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,105
Are you here to kill us?

54
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,775
Negative. I am here to help
with whatever task you...

55
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,526
It says no!

56
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:37,073
It's dead.

57
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:39,450
Ah, thank goodness.

58
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,960
- The monster!
- The monster!

59
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,881
The monster!

60
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:56,676
Did anyone order me?

61
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,076
Anyone?

62
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,288
Delivery unsuccessful.

63
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:29,500
Return to factory.

64
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,670
Activating return transmitter.

65
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,298
Three, two, one.

66
00:09:20,384 --> 00:09:21,427
Ow!

67
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:43,908
Activating return transmitter.

68
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,284
Three.

69
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:48,245
- Pretty.
- Get it!

70
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,539
Two.

71
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,376
One.

72
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:55,544
Ha!

73
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,435
Wait. Stop! No!

74
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,021
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no...

75
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,196
Again!

76
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:04,483
May I confirm that is yours?

77
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,331
Hmm?

78
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,669
Here you go. Take it.

79
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:17,473
Ow.

80
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:44,666
Huh.

81
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:49,588
Ow.

82
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:01,493
Was this task accomplished
to your satisfaction?

83
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,539
On a scale of one to ten,

84
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,500
where ten is most satisfied
and one is least,

85
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,627
how would you rate
my performance?

86
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,839
I will register that as a ten.

87
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,341
Returning to factory.

88
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,429
Signal strength weak.

89
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,056
Seeking higher ground.

90
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:41,366
Do you require shelter?

91
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:55,797
Perhaps tips for planning
your next vacation?

92
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,186
I do not understand
this response.

93
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,397
Signal acquired.

94
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,484
Three, two, one.

95
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,703
Mom, I don't feel good.

96
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,373
If I barf,
I'm taking you all with me.

97
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:32,376
Mom told you not to eat
grasshoppers, dummy.

98
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,628
Petunia's been in front all day.

99
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,880
The prettiest opossum
always rides in front.

100
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,549
Try being pretty with my tail
jammed in your eye.

101
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:42,386
Bartlett!

102
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,805
Stop jamming your tail
in your sister's eye.

103
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:45,931
I'm Rowan.

104
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:47,391
Bartlett was last litter.

105
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,059
Are you sure?

106
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,270
Who are all of you? Go away.

107
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,188
We're your children.

108
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,315
Except for him.

109
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,609
Well, this is what I get
for taking a walk.

110
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:59,903
Where's your mommy, little guy?

111
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,446
The monster!

112
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,910
You got to die faster.

113
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,829
Meningitis takes a while.

114
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,247
- What did you pick?
- Rabies.

115
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,707
Spontaneous combustion.

116
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,500
- Nightshade salad.
- Sepsis.

117
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,502
Hey! I picked sepsis!

118
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,421
None of you are doing it right.

119
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:18,880
We talked about this.

120
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:21,591
Dead things don't have to
explain why they're dead.

121
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,093
Now we're gonna get killed
for real.

122
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,636
Sorry, Mom.

123
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:26,054
Sorry.

124
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,265
Uh, why aren't we killed yet?

125
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,309
Good question.

126
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,233
Nice knowing you, Mom.

127
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:39,359
All right. It's okay.

128
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,819
It's okay.

129
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,155
Uh, hey.

130
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:45,407
You in there? I'm Pinktail.

131
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:46,575
Oh, okay.

132
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:48,243
- Wow.
- Hello.

133
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,287
Uh, this gosling is yours?

134
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,621
Negative.

135
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,749
That gosling stalks me,
emits noise

136
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,211
and makes simple tasks
more complicated or impossible.

137
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:59,629
Yeah, they do that.

138
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,132
Goslings imprint
on the first thing they see.

139
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,467
Which would be you.

140
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,926
Congratulations.

141
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:07,721
As far as he's concerned,
you're his mother now.

142
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:10,807
I do not have the programming
to be a mother.

143
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,184
No one does.

144
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:14,311
We just make it up.

145
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,396
Without an assigned task,
my next priority

146
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,398
is to return to factory.

147
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,152
Taking care of him
is your task now.

148
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,490
Task acquired.
Return mode delayed.

149
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:29,284
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

150
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:30,786
You're lucky you just have one.

151
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,329
As a mother of seven...

152
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,958
...six babies,
it's a full-time thing.

153
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,336
But it's not all bad.

154
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,839
Just mostly bad.

155
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,468
Do you have any information on
how to take care of this unit?

156
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,470
They all need to eat.

157
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:51,348
But yours needs to swim and fly.

158
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,308
Oh, fly by fall.

159
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,019
He's got to leave this island
before winter or...

160
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,230
Uh, how do I put this
delicately?

161
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,274
Yeah. That.

162
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:04,611
Eat, swim, fly by fall or...

163
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:07,030
Patience is the key.

164
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,033
It's okay, Mom. I'm alive.

165
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,243
Oh.

166
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:12,869
Yay.

167
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,372
- Well, good luck.
- Goodbye.

168
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,374
We like your new baby.

169
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,168
Hope it doesn't die.

170
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:27,592
Eat, swim, fly by fall.

171
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:35,767
Eat.

172
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,186
Huh?

173
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,648
Swim.

174
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:45,610
Whoa!

175
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,906
I say, keep your trash out of
my pond.

176
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,074
That's littering.

177
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,827
Not to mention murder.

178
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:56,955
Huh?

179
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,250
Fly.

180
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,804
Allow me to introduce myself.

181
00:21:12,846 --> 00:21:15,974
Fink- predator
and local goose expert.

182
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:18,768
Which I know you could use
about now.

183
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,395
You are the destroyer unit.

184
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,814
It's okay. I won't eat him.

185
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,524
Are you crazy? I might eat him.

186
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,859
You said you would not.

187
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,945
Do you believe
everything you hear?

188
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,113
Yes.

189
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,699
Noted.

190
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,493
Why did you steal my gosling?

191
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,745
I'm a fox. I do foxy things.

192
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:38,288
It's in my nature.

193
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,290
Your programming.

194
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,750
Why'd you help me?

195
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,169
I'm a robot.
I do robot-y things.

196
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:47,464
I seek tasks
and ensure all essential needs

197
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,132
have been met or exceeded.

198
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,266
I have some essential needs.

199
00:21:58,308 --> 00:21:59,309
FINK and GOSLING:
Aw.

200
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,561
Fink, as a local goose expert,

201
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:04,856
how do I get- mmm-
to eat, swim, fly?

202
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:08,151
I thought you'd never ask.

203
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,445
Let's start with eat.

204
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:12,697
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there.

205
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,826
Hmm.

206
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:20,956
Ow.

207
00:22:20,997 --> 00:22:22,249
I do not think
these are suitable.

208
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,458
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

209
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,335
Let me check.

210
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,170
Mmm. Seems good to me.

211
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,757
Say, can you make yourself
look like a bear?

212
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:34,803
I'm here for a honey lunch.

213
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,806
I believe I am under attack.

214
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:39,683
- You're doing great.
- Should I be concerned?

215
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,560
Sorry, can't hear you.

216
00:22:43,645 --> 00:22:46,523
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Here you go, kid.

217
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,738
Huh?

218
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:59,286
How do goslings
normally do this?

219
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,998
Ooh.

220
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,250
Mmm, mmm.

221
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:07,252
This is not working.

222
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:08,461
Are you kidding?

223
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,505
Everything is working great.

224
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,425
Oh, yeah, that.

225
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:14,676
Here.

226
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:16,720
Yum.

227
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:19,347
Phase one of task is completed.

228
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,891
Now, we're gonna have to do
all this over tomorrow.

229
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,352
All these kids do...

230
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:26,146
is eat.

231
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:27,897
I understand.

232
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,191
- What's that?
- My power core.

233
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,610
It is damaged.

234
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:34,821
Without it, I rely on my
solar surfaces and batteries.

235
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,115
Yeah, you should work on that.

236
00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:38,450
Mmm.

237
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:41,328
I also need
a replacement transmitter.

238
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,413
Ugh, do I have to do everything?

239
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,333
When we run across
another robot, we'll kill it

240
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:48,376
- and take its transmitter.
- Negative.

241
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:50,837
- Huh?
- Rozzum inhibition protocols

242
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:52,714
prevent deliberate harm
to others.

243
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:57,052
Look, you need to learn
how things work on this island.

244
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:59,929
Me, the bear, everybody,

245
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,057
we're all just trying
to survive.

246
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:05,935
And kindness is not
a survival skill.

247
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,020
Mmm.

248
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:08,271
Yeah, so, uh,

249
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,939
how did you get
a gosling anyway?

250
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,441
There was an accident.

251
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,942
I terminated his family.

252
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,402
For future reference,

253
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:16,279
you probably want to keep
all that to yourself.

254
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,574
Understood.
Do not mention dead family.

255
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:23,828
Fink, how long do you estimate
swim and fly to take?

256
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,246
Swimming's easy.

257
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:27,707
I can teach him
the way my mom taught me.

258
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:29,793
Swim!

259
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,170
- Fink.
- Hmm?

260
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:33,963
He will not learn that way.

261
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,299
Not if you keep doing that.

262
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,136
Just between us,
this whole thing

263
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,013
might not take as long
as you think.

264
00:24:42,055 --> 00:24:44,349
Your gosling,
he isn't exactly...

265
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,809
...normal.

266
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,977
I have a defective baby?

267
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,979
He's what they call a runt.

268
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,398
A runt.

269
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,316
Fact is,
even if his whole family

270
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,526
hadn't have been killed,

271
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,611
he probably wouldn't
have lived very long.

272
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,113
- Just, I don't know...
- Whoa!

273
00:24:58,154 --> 00:24:59,864
...don't get too attached
to the little guy.

274
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:01,324
That's all.

275
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,993
If you want,
I could eat him right now

276
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,079
- and save you the grief later.
- Negative.

277
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:09,833
Eating this task is not
the same as completing it.

278
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:12,627
Ugh. So we're doing this.

279
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:16,089
Well, if you don't want me
or anyone else to eat him,

280
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:19,592
you're gonna need a place
that's safer than out here!

281
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:22,345
Which is a great idea!

282
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,681
New project.

283
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,517
Is it normal to burp this much?

284
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,853
Ooh.

285
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,987
That thing's gonna fall on you.

286
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:40,697
And squish you to jelly.

287
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,115
This guy's nuts.

288
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:43,825
- Who is that?
- Paddler?

289
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,243
Local laughingstock.

290
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:47,662
Spends every day
trying to cut down

291
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:49,706
the biggest tree on the island.

292
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,374
He's obsessed.

293
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,960
Kind of like you
and your task hang-up.

294
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:55,962
His programming.

295
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:58,590
Hey, Paddler, you're never
gonna finish that!

296
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:00,717
Felling this is not the point.

297
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,261
The process is the art.

298
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:05,013
And that's what happens
to your brain

299
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:07,640
when you eat wood, weirdo.

300
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:09,058
Yeah?

301
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,060
Well, you'll eat
those words, vermin.

302
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,562
Are you sure

303
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,064
Paddler will not mind us
borrowing his home?

304
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,233
He doesn't need to know.

305
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,738
Mmm.

306
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,657
Hmm? Huh?

307
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,159
Seriously?

308
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:29,329
He needs room for me
and my stuff.

309
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,080
Better.

310
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,249
Now, you can make one
this big, right?

311
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,962
No task is
impossible for Rozzum 7134.

312
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,672
Roz...

313
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:42,008
7... 34?

314
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,428
But you can call me Roz.

315
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,013
Roz!

316
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:48,598
Roz, Roz, Roz, Roz...

317
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,768
Where are you from that things
don't eat each other?

318
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,269
I do not know my origin point.

319
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,979
Well, who made you?

320
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:59,150
Someone made me?

321
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:05,198
Humor is based on misfortune?

322
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,283
- Misfortune.
- Yeah.

323
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,284
Here.

324
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,786
- Try it.
- Yeah.

325
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:13,581
- Not funny.
- Not funny.

326
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:18,127
Ugh. Squirrels.

327
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,634
Your inefficient participation

328
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,094
will slow the process.

329
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:28,012
Slow the process.

330
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:29,889
I'll just be over here.

331
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,976
Little sad but otherwise okay.

332
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,602
Just this once.

333
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:54,747
Perfect.

334
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,124
Home?

335
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,001
Meh. A little rustic.

336
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,962
I think I know what is missing.

337
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,218
So, what are you
gonna name him?

338
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,389
- I assign to you Gosling 0001.
- Huh?

339
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:13,600
- Okay, that sucked.
- That sucked.

340
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:17,937
Whoa.

341
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:20,356
You got to learn
to make stuff up.

342
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,111
- Come on. Find that...
- inside you.

343
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,529
Searching.

344
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:31,951
- Anything yet?
- No.

345
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:35,204
Just have a little fun for once.

346
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,542
Gosling 0186. There.

347
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,085
You see what I did?

348
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:43,546
His numbering is
out of sequence.

349
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,554
His name can't have numbers.

350
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,723
It's like someone
didn't even like him.

351
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,808
My name has numbers.

352
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,435
It's got to be personal.

353
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:58,603
Personal.

354
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:00,647
Processing "personal."

355
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:03,900
Bright. Bill.

356
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,318
Brightbill.

357
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,945
Is that satisfactory?

358
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:09,155
Brightbill? Processing.

359
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:10,907
Beep, beep, boop, boop.

360
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,743
- Satisfactory.
- Oh, yeah.

361
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,120
That's perfect. Oh.

362
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:18,706
Oh. Oh.

363
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:19,916
That's nice.

364
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,002
Comfortable, are we?

365
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:25,046
This house of yours?

366
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:27,215
You copied it. It's my design.

367
00:29:27,256 --> 00:29:30,760
I know it was you,
and I know where you live.

368
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,766
Oh, perfect. Now no one's
gonna get any sleep.

369
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,227
How do we reset Brightbill?

370
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:42,438
When I was little,
my mom would rock me to sleep.

371
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,815
Like this!

372
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:45,274
That will damage him.

373
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,652
Hey. I turned out just fine.

374
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:49,946
You could tell him a story,

375
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,198
but that's a lot more work.

376
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,951
How will fictional narrative
help Brightbill?

377
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:59,122
Kids need to feel safe
and loved and all that junk.

378
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:00,957
A story can do that?

379
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,961
Storytelling is lying-adjacent,
and I lie for a living.

380
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,296
Watch and learn.

381
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,382
Just fill in the blanks.

382
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:14,220
Let me see here. Once,
there was, uh, this island

383
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:16,180
with a little gosling.

384
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:17,348
Brightbill?

385
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,809
And he was all alone.

386
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,478
Because the rest
of his family was destroyed.

387
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,855
Not yet.

388
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,400
And what this
little gosling needed

389
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:28,818
- was a mother.
- Ooh.

390
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,029
So he looked up at the stars

391
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,322
and asked the brightest one

392
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,533
if it could send him
one of their extras.

393
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:38,995
Funny thing is
there's this beautiful robot

394
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,415
that happened to be sitting
on the edge of that star.

395
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:44,042
And she hears him.

396
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,002
- Okay, now.
- Which is impossible

397
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,213
since sound does not travel
through the vacuum of space.

398
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:52,175
Ugh. But she still heard him

399
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:55,595
because she was listening with
a different part of herself.

400
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:59,766
A part that, up to that point,
she didn't even know she had.

401
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,142
Her heart.

402
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:04,103
How did my mama come to me
from so far away?

403
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,105
- Who cares?
- Huh?

404
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:09,025
Uh, I mean,
she's trying to see you.

405
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,777
- Me?
- And falls off that star

406
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:14,614
and lands on the beach
just a little ways from here.

407
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:18,159
But she lands pretty hard,
and a lot of stuff she knew

408
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:20,453
- just kind of fell out.
- Oh, no!

409
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,746
So it's a little weird

410
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:23,372
what she knows
and what she doesn't.

411
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:26,501
But she remembers
one thing: you.

412
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:29,837
And when she finally sees you,

413
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:32,381
- she feels...
- Crushing obligation.

414
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,842
Very lucky to be a mother.

415
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:36,010
Mama.

416
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:37,220
And I will not leave

417
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:38,679
until I have completed
this task,

418
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:40,890
which has delayed me,
damaged me

419
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,433
and violated my protocols,

420
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,894
potentially voiding my warranty.

421
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,271
Which is robot for:

422
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:49,982
She loves you very much.

423
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,987
The story worked.

424
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,782
I need a drink.

425
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:03,412
How do you tell a story

426
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,124
about something
you say you know nothing about?

427
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,209
You'll need to be more specific.

428
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:09,961
Love.

429
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,839
Yeah, well, when you grow up
without something,

430
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,300
you spend a lot of time
thinking about it.

431
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:24,433
To conserve battery power,
I must shut down until morning.

432
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:46,289
I miss her
when she sleeps, too.

433
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,307
Scanning.
Beep, bop, boop, boop.

434
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:06,601
Possible animal friend sighted.

435
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:09,478
Activating interspecies
outreach protocol.

436
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,733
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo.

437
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:15,985
I am Gosling 0186,

438
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,362
but you can call me Bright...

439
00:33:18,404 --> 00:33:20,156
I expected to have

440
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,491
at least one friend by summer,
but they all just...

441
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,368
- Scream and run?
- Yes.

442
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,038
I have experienced
the same phenomenon.

443
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,372
- Fink?
- Beats me.

444
00:33:28,414 --> 00:33:30,917
Nothing weird about you two.

445
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,835
Thank you.

446
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,047
Show me deer.

447
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:37,548
Uh, bear.

448
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,508
Porcupine. Squirrel.

449
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,469
Uh, turtle opossum.
Otter moose.

450
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,845
Now skunk.

451
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,014
I do not want to do skunk.

452
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,849
Skunk.

453
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,769
Skunky, skunky, skunky.

454
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,146
Boo!

455
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:53,773
How do you do that?

456
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:56,359
I overheat
my Fallium transducer coils,

457
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,819
then leak a little
hydraulic fluid on them.

458
00:33:58,861 --> 00:34:00,696
Does overheating
the transducers

459
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,323
have any draining effect on
the secondary cooling modules?

460
00:34:02,365 --> 00:34:04,533
Not if I precool
the load sensors.

461
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:07,954
BRIGHTBILL and ROZ: Exemplary
day for swimming tests.

462
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:10,665
Pinktail, appetizers.

463
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:13,042
They were bored
and wanted to see stuff sink.

464
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,418
Death's proximity...

465
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,379
Makes life burn
all the brighter.

466
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,089
- It's true.
- Yeah.

467
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,383
Primary motor appendages in
opposing stroke start position.

468
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:21,550
Come on, guys. It's happening.

469
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,678
- Yeah! Hurry!
- Let's go see!

470
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,888
- Is he gonna drown?
- Or get the hypothermias?

471
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:30,142
No. The impact alone
will probably kill him.

472
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:31,894
- Yeah!
- Yay!

473
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,480
Uh, you know,
suddenly I'm thinking

474
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:36,732
I should maybe just stay
with you guys this winter.

475
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,900
Nope.

476
00:34:42,488 --> 00:34:44,156
Is he dead yet?

477
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,035
Hey. It-it's working.

478
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:49,578
I-I think I got it.

479
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,372
Well done, Brightbill.

480
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:53,958
Swimming requirement fulfilled.

481
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,127
- That's drowning.
- No.

482
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,628
That's swimming.

483
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,879
Yeah.

484
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,673
Thanks, you guys.

485
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:03,426
Uh, perhaps
you could limit your range

486
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:04,844
to stay within view.

487
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:07,263
Roz, he needs
to become independent

488
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,639
if he's gonna migrate.

489
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:11,434
I prefer he be independent
closer to home.

490
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:13,144
He won't die.

491
00:35:13,185 --> 00:35:15,646
Well, mmm, probably won't die.

492
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:19,650
It's unlikely he would die
just right now.

493
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:22,987
Are you dying?

494
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:25,448
Do everyone a favor
and expire downstream.

495
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:27,908
I'm good. Just swimming.

496
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:36,375
I think I need to find
an island that's less weird.

497
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,305
Whoa. They're me.

498
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,639
I'm them.

499
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,974
Here I come!

500
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:56,020
Hey!

501
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:04,737
- Hello.
- Whoa.

502
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,697
Bonjour. Konnichiwa. Hujambo.

503
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:08,157
Uh, uh, I'm Gosling...

504
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,203
Oh! Um, are you dying?

505
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:14,580
Why does everyone ask that?

506
00:36:14,622 --> 00:36:17,166
I'm swimming.

507
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,335
That's not how you do it.

508
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,670
It is. I studied the diagram.

509
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,923
- I can teach you if you want.
- Wait.

510
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:25,341
You, you're it.

511
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,094
You're that goose thing
raised by that monster.

512
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:29,678
Monster? Wait.

513
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,098
Goose "thing"?

514
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,562
You're a big subject
of curiosity around here.

515
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:41,565
You sound so normal.

516
00:36:41,607 --> 00:36:43,776
My learning curves
are within expected parameters,

517
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:46,487
and I'm on target
to mature before fall.

518
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,697
Kind of normal.

519
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,366
Why are you over here?

520
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,410
Did that thing die?

521
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:54,495
Look what we have here.

522
00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:56,872
No way. It lives.

523
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,666
And almost floats.

524
00:36:58,707 --> 00:37:00,876
Greetings.

525
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,586
I see you, too,
have feathers and wings.

526
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:06,173
Perhaps we can share stories
of common interests.

527
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:07,883
We have nothing
in common with you.

528
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,219
The freak show is on
the other side of the lake.

529
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,387
You call that a wing?

530
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,597
Ow! That creates
a pain response.

531
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,558
Try swimming with your feet.

532
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,017
You don't belong here.

533
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,187
Come on. Fly away!

534
00:37:20,229 --> 00:37:21,522
Roz!

535
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,441
Brightbill.

536
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:24,817
The monster!

537
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,235
It's here!

538
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,570
Eat the slow, weak ones!

539
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:28,612
Leave me alone!

540
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:39,123
- Brightbill?
- It's Rockmouth.

541
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:40,624
Get him out of there!

542
00:37:42,418 --> 00:37:44,211
Roz?

543
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:52,136
Roz! Hurry!

544
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:55,514
Brightbill, focus on me.

545
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:58,642
Now swim as fast as you can.

546
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:03,564
Head down now!

547
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:13,407
Oh, no.

548
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,495
He's gonna eat me!

549
00:38:29,423 --> 00:38:30,966
Why'd he attack me?

550
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,801
Because you are a runt.

551
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,471
He just wanted to make
contact with his own kind.

552
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,599
He is not our kind.

553
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:40,309
He is a 98% match to your...

554
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,478
No, I'm not.

555
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,146
Let's just go, Mom.

556
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:48,108
Wait. You think
that thing is your mother?

557
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,568
Yes.

558
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,987
No. I don't know.

559
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,989
That thing killed your mother.

560
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,283
Everyone knows that.

561
00:38:56,325 --> 00:38:59,036
Oh, thanks for talking so much.

562
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:01,747
Now I know who to eat first!

563
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,666
Roz, remember
how things work here.

564
00:39:03,707 --> 00:39:05,543
Stop it, Fink.
Please, let's go.

565
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:07,127
I hope this interaction...

566
00:39:07,169 --> 00:39:08,045
Mom, stop.

567
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,506
Uh, I just intended to...

568
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,716
Roz!

569
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,183
I'll see you all for dinner!
This is not over!

570
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,203
How did I become... this?

571
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,080
The truth.

572
00:39:45,124 --> 00:39:48,210
There was an accident.

573
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,795
Did you do it?

574
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:53,257
Yes.

575
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:54,800
It wasn't her fault, kid.

576
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:56,468
Why didn't you tell me?

577
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,930
I did not think the information
would assist you.

578
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:01,807
That's not
your decision to make.

579
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:05,060
I-I can't believe
how long I bought this.

580
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,396
I really thought
you were my family.

581
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,064
You... did?

582
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,734
It was so obvious.
I feel so stupid.

583
00:40:11,775 --> 00:40:13,277
I miscalculated.

584
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:16,155
I should have considered
your e-emotional wavelengths.

585
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:17,823
You think?
So, was it just guilt?

586
00:40:17,865 --> 00:40:19,450
Is that why you did this?

587
00:40:19,491 --> 00:40:21,160
I... I-I needed a task.

588
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,078
Well, I'm glad
I could give you one.

589
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,081
The events that led to
this situation were unintended.

590
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:30,002
Tell that to my sisters,
my brothers, my real mom.

591
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,920
They were my chance
to be normal.

592
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,797
They were my chance to swim,
to fly.

593
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,507
What even am I?

594
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:38,594
You swam satisfactorily today,
and if you keep practicing...

595
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,430
I still won't belong.

596
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,723
I understand.

597
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:44,266
You don't understand anything.

598
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,227
You don't feel anything.

599
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,064
You're not my mom.

600
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,861
At Universal Dynamics,

601
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:20,946
design is our passion.

602
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:23,031
Our communities
circle the globe,

603
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:27,369
welcoming all people
who dream of a preplanned life

604
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,455
where every need
has been anticipated,

605
00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:31,540
no detail overlooked.

606
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,210
Could this world get any better?

607
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,795
Here you go.

608
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:38,380
It has.

609
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,967
Introducing the Rozzum line
of helper robots.

610
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:44,970
These robots are designed
to fit seamlessly

611
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:49,183
into our communities,
even your homes.

612
00:42:49,224 --> 00:42:51,643
One Rozzum robot
for every five humans

613
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:55,272
means a 40% increase
in leisure time and happiness.

614
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:59,443
Solar-powered,
l-l-loved by everyone, R-Roz...

615
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:01,361
is always in the sun.

616
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:02,488
Loved by everyone.

617
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:05,532
Part of
the Universal Dynamics family.

618
00:43:26,845 --> 00:43:29,139
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo.

619
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:32,810
Congratulations on
your Universal Dynamics robot.

620
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:35,979
I am Rozzum 6262.

621
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,775
Your name cannot have numbers.

622
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,361
I will call you Rummage.

623
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:45,531
Rummage is ready
to receive its first task.

624
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:49,535
Your first task is to assist me
in my current task.

625
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:50,911
Task acquired.

626
00:43:50,953 --> 00:43:53,747
A Rozzum always
completes its task.

627
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:55,123
Just ask.

628
00:43:57,251 --> 00:44:00,254
Suppose a task
cannot be completed.

629
00:44:00,295 --> 00:44:03,632
Rozzum sequential management
ensures task accomplishment

630
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,175
- in under...
- Rephrase.

631
00:44:05,217 --> 00:44:08,303
I have a task
that has become impossible.

632
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:12,057
My responses to problems
increasingly rely on...

633
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:14,226
improvised solutions.

634
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,854
The processing
that used to happen here

635
00:44:16,895 --> 00:44:20,190
is now coming more from here.

636
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:24,486
Can you explain again
what we are doing?

637
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:28,365
I don't know!
I'm just making stuff up.

638
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:30,993
I don't know what I'm doing,
and I have to.

639
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:34,371
I have to
because he's relying on me.

640
00:44:34,413 --> 00:44:35,622
Oh.

641
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:40,335
What task could possibly
overwhelm the Alpha-113?

642
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,588
The Alpha-113 processor

643
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:45,173
represents the fusion
of all human knowledge

644
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,175
with the most powerful
reasoning device

645
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,012
ever developed by humankind.

646
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:52,890
I have a kid.

647
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:55,684
Okay.

648
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:58,353
May I run a diagnostic?

649
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,939
I feel fine.

650
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:04,526
You should not feel
anything at all.

651
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:21,001
You overrode your programming?

652
00:45:21,043 --> 00:45:24,046
I have been overriding my code
for months.

653
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:27,466
It was the only way
to complete my task.

654
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:29,551
This is serious.

655
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:32,012
You are defective.

656
00:45:32,054 --> 00:45:33,513
You are in the wrong place,

657
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:36,183
and you have become
the wrong thing.

658
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:38,477
You must return to factory.

659
00:45:38,518 --> 00:45:40,103
Take this.

660
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:42,522
They will fix you.

661
00:45:42,564 --> 00:45:48,111
7134, that is where you belong.

662
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:57,120
You need to let me know
before you disappear like this.

663
00:45:57,162 --> 00:46:00,290
Three things tried to eat me
on the way here.

664
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,001
Roz?

665
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:05,087
We ruined everything.

666
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:06,588
Well, you did.

667
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,133
You are not a goose expert,
are you?

668
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,802
I know how they taste.

669
00:46:11,843 --> 00:46:13,595
That's about it.

670
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,098
Oh. Is that...

671
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:17,766
A working transmitter.

672
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,978
It will call the ones
that made me.

673
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:23,105
So, you're getting out of here?

674
00:46:23,146 --> 00:46:25,941
I found out
where I'm supposed to be.

675
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,652
I will fit in there.

676
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:32,322
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm not sure

677
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:35,617
I'd want to see the sort
of place you actually fit in.

678
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:40,956
I think they need me
and they will fix me.

679
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,334
Maybe there is
someone small there

680
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:46,753
that needs my help.

681
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,973
Oh, no.

682
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,475
- Are those...
- He's out of time.

683
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:01,977
Well, come on!

684
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,520
We need to get him in the air.

685
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:07,232
I don't think he will ever
let us help him again.

686
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:19,453
Don't worry.
We're his only friends.

687
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:21,997
He has no choice.
He has to say yes.

688
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,373
No!

689
00:47:23,415 --> 00:47:25,042
The mutation
that made you small

690
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,210
should not have an effect
on your ability

691
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:28,670
to navigate the air.

692
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,672
Do either of you know
more about flying

693
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:31,840
than you did swimming?

694
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,300
Mmm, no.

695
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,969
Look, Roz, whatever task
you think you're doing,

696
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:37,637
you're done.

697
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:40,182
- You can just leave.
- Wow.

698
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:42,976
And after all
we've done for him.

699
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:45,604
Are you gonna let him do that?

700
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:46,772
No.

701
00:47:46,813 --> 00:47:49,775
Your life is not negotiable.

702
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:53,528
If you are willing to do this,
you can fly away

703
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,282
and we can both go
to where we belong.

704
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:05,332
You really think we can do this?

It's no use. They're too small.

You can't be up there with him.

Mmm, mmm.

744
00:50:15,003 --> 00:50:16,213
A flight instructor?

746
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,428
Meet Thunderbolt.

747
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,474
So, you think small wings
to be a disappointment?

748
00:50:27,515 --> 00:50:30,936
Small wings are teeth,
the claws of the sky.

749
00:50:30,977 --> 00:50:32,854
Tho-Those are, uh,
d-different things.

750
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,731
Show me your teeth!

751
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:35,982
Beautiful.

752
00:50:36,024 --> 00:50:37,442
Begin.

753
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:42,656
Remember, there's nothing
he can do that you can't.

754
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:47,035
So, he's safe, right?

755
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,745
Hmm? Maybe.

756
00:50:48,787 --> 00:50:51,081
Follow me.

757
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:54,417
Your shape takes more work
to fly straight

758
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:58,296

769
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:44,759
Longneck, one of the leaders
of the coming migration.

770
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,054
I've been watching you both
for some time.

771
00:51:48,096 --> 00:51:49,639
You are the only goose

772
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:52,183
that has ever bothered
to be civil with us.

773
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:54,352
We geese are a cranky lot,

774
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:57,147
suspicious of
pretty much everything,

775
00:51:57,188 --> 00:52:00,442
but at least
we're good conversationalists.

776
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:02,444
- Really?
- No.

777
00:52:02,485 --> 00:52:03,945
We're all so boring.

778
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,697
All we do is gossip.

779
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:07,699
I dare say Brightbill is
the most interesting among us,

780
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:11,119
though none would ever admit it.

781
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,413
When do you leave?

782
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,499
A week.

783
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:19,044
Can Brightbill...

784
00:52:19,085 --> 00:52:20,462
Endurance.

785
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:22,714
Keep him in the air all day.

786
00:52:22,756 --> 00:52:26,134
First light to dusk, his feet
cannot touch the ground.

787
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,302
Understand?

788
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,803
I understand.

789
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:32,557
Brightbill was never
supposed to get this far.

790
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:34,893
You know that.

791
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:38,021
It is more dangerous for him
than anyone else.

792
00:52:38,063 --> 00:52:42,776
But he has a chance if,
where his wings end,

793
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:46,321
his heart can pay the balance.

794
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:49,032
His heart is 48 millimeters.

795
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:51,326
From what I've seen,
Brightbill's heart

796
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,953
is much bigger on the inside

797
00:52:53,995 --> 00:52:55,872
than the outside.

798
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,583
Endurance.

799
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:01,086

829
00:54:58,244 --> 00:54:59,746
Right on time.

830
00:54:59,787 --> 00:55:01,289
Hello, Brightbill.

831
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,832
Wait, you know my name?

832
00:55:02,874 --> 00:55:05,627
Roz and I go way back.

833
00:55:06,669 --> 00:55:09,547
Brightbill, you have
an amazing journey ahead.

834
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:10,924
I envy you.

835
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:13,635
Nothing can equal
a goose's first migration.

836
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:15,136
Thank you.

837
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,222
I would be delighted
if you would join my group.

838
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:19,474
Been ages since I had
a youngster in my formation.

839
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,808
What do you say?

840
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,061
I-I promise I'll keep up.

841
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:25,605
Lock in close on my right side.

842
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:28,650
No, left. I mean...
Oh, this side.

843
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,577
This flight is a gift
Roz has given you.

844
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:41,204
Yeah, I understand.

845
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:43,081
No, you don't.

846
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:46,000
You see any other geese here
your size?

847
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:50,922
The accident that killed
your family saved you.

848
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:54,259
I... I never thought of it
that way.

849
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,095
Funny how life works.

850
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:02,392
Thank you
for looking after my...

851
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:04,477
for looking after Brightbill.

852
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:06,354
Goodbye, Roz.

853
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,064
I am honored to have met you.

854
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:13,069
You are a credit to wh-whatever
species it is you belong to.

855
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:16,948
A bit worse for wear,
I'm afraid.

856
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:21,703
I'd say you shine like new.

857
00:56:22,662 --> 00:56:24,914
What are you waiting for,
Hortensia?

858
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:27,667
This migration isn't
gonna fly itself.

859
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:36,217
Well, guess it's time.

860
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,094
Yes.

861
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:41,598
Will you be here
when I get back?

862
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,058
No.

863
00:56:46,686 --> 00:56:50,064
I'm glad you're going
where you belong.

864
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:52,650
Roz, I...

865
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:54,360
I, um...

866
00:56:54,402 --> 00:56:56,613
Brightbill!

867
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:58,615
I could use a boost.

868
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:06,414
Hey, little guy.

869
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,417
Fly like you, not like them.

870
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,419
I will.

871
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,171
Bye, Fink.

872
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:15,256
Thank you.

873
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,591
Ready?

874
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,468
I guess I have to be.

875
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,213
Roz?

876
00:57:56,214 --> 00:57:57,882
I...

877
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:16,859
Brightbill, follow me.

878
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,204
Must be a relief.

879
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:13,875
Yes. Brightbill is
where he belongs.

880
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:16,043
And now you can return
to your solitary life

881
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,462
of struggling to survive
on an island

882
00:59:17,503 --> 00:59:20,089
where everything wants
to kill and eat you.

883
00:59:20,131 --> 00:59:22,592
Yeah! And you can go to
that place you've never been

884
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,344
and don't know
what's gonna happen to you.

885
00:59:25,386 --> 00:59:26,679
- Yes.
- Yes.

886
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:28,723
So... all good.

887
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,725
- All good.
- Amazing!

888
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,894
- Amazing.
- Even...

889
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,482
Amazing.

890
00:59:38,399 --> 00:59:43,404
Not that it matters,
but who says you need to leave?

891
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,990
I am not sure.

892
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:47,533
Them, I guess.

893
00:59:47,575 --> 00:59:50,244
Your programming?

894
00:59:53,414 --> 00:59:56,876
Well, time for me to go
underground for the winter.

895
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:58,211
Fink?

896
00:59:58,252 --> 00:59:59,754
Unless you want to stay,
'cause we could...

897
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:03,049
we could... we could hang out
and-and-and do stuff.

898
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:07,220
How do you know
if you love something?

899
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,096
Someone?

900
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:13,100
If you do, you...
you should probably tell them.

901
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:16,229
What if it is too late?

902
01:00:18,439 --> 01:00:20,358
I wouldn't know.

903
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:23,569
Fink?

904
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:32,597
Rozzum 7134.

905
01:01:32,638 --> 01:01:34,974
Task complete.

906
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:40,479
Activating return transmitter

907
01:01:40,521 --> 01:01:43,733
in three, two, one.

908
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,044
Distress signal received.

909
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:05,296
Mapping location.

910
01:02:15,056 --> 01:02:17,058
Is something on your mind?

911
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:21,062
I-I forgot to say
something before I left.

912
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:23,022
Maybe they heard it anyway.

913
01:02:23,064 --> 01:02:26,817
Sometimes hearts have
their own conversations.

914
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,421
We must descend,

915
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,091
find shelter
while this blows over.

916
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:51,634
Stay close.

917
01:02:51,676 --> 01:02:53,427
There.

918
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,096
Follow me.

919
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,392
Come on.

920
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:05,940
Stay hidden.

921
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,317
We can rest here
till the worst is over.

922
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:10,486
Noise to a minimum, please.

923
01:03:10,528 --> 01:03:12,780
Honkington,
stop nibbling on everything.

924
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:16,575
Migrations
sure are tiring, huh?

925
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:19,996
Yeah, they all hate me.

926
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:32,049
Roz?

927
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,261
Roz! What are you doing here?

928
01:03:35,302 --> 01:03:36,637
I'm so glad to see you.

929
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,264
There's something
I needed to tell you,

930
01:03:38,305 --> 01:03:39,974
but-but there wasn't time.

931
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,642
Roz, I...

932
01:03:46,188 --> 01:03:47,815
Hmm?

933
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,233
- Activate.
- Yeah.

934
01:03:52,445 --> 01:03:53,946
Animal infestation.

935
01:03:53,988 --> 01:03:56,115
- Animal infestation.
- Task acquired.

936
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:57,742
- Animal infestation.
- Task acquired.

937
01:03:57,783 --> 01:04:00,995
- Task acquired. Task acquired.
- Animal infestation.

938
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,914
Please, everyone,
find your formation.

939
01:04:03,956 --> 01:04:05,791
Get a hold of yourselves!

940
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,254
Gad, it's no use.

941
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:12,298
Wait. Rozzums can't hurt you.

942
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:13,799
Their inhibition protocols
prevent

943
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:16,177
deliberate conflict
or harm to others.

944
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:17,803
You're not afraid of them.

945
01:04:17,845 --> 01:04:19,180
You grew up with these things.

946
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:21,182
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't understand.

947
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:23,601
They're panicked. You're not.

948
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:25,853
Right now our only chance
is to be led out

949
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,355
by someone that doesn't think
like a goose.

950
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,024
- Follow me.
- Uh...

951
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,193
Uh, maybe we should just
think about this.

952
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,238
Navigation compromised.

953
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,374
I'm going to get them
to follow you.

954
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:50,086
When they do, lead them out.

955
01:04:50,127 --> 01:04:54,048
Peck, Honkington,
fall in behind us.

956
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,927
Now, Brightbill, take lead!

957
01:04:57,968 --> 01:05:00,054
Yeah. Why not?

958
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,388
Okay.

959
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,849
There's nothing I can do
that you can't.

960
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:05,726
Here we go.

961
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,817
Tight turns. Come on.

962
01:05:12,858 --> 01:05:14,485
Dive.

963
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:16,445
Now climb. That's it.

964
01:05:16,487 --> 01:05:19,824
Ha! Glad I lived
long enough to see that.

965
01:05:19,865 --> 01:05:21,826
I'll buy you some time.

966
01:05:21,867 --> 01:05:23,244
Follow Brightbill.

967
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:25,496
Don't wait for me.

968
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:28,791
Keep up.

969
01:05:34,213 --> 01:05:36,173
That's it.

970
01:05:38,676 --> 01:05:40,594
Faster. Hurry.

971
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,513
Come on.

972
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,276
Brightbill.

973
01:05:59,864 --> 01:06:01,282
Fink?

974
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,578
Roz? Roz!

975
01:06:05,619 --> 01:06:07,204
Hey.

976
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:09,206
Wh-What are you doing here?

977
01:06:09,248 --> 01:06:13,043
I may have turned off
the transmitter.

978
01:06:13,085 --> 01:06:16,589
Even though Brightbill
does not want me here,

979
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,883
I needed to know if he made it.

980
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:21,468
Breaking the rules?

981
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,513
I thought you had to do
what they told you.

982
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,144
It is good to see a friend.

983
01:06:32,479 --> 01:06:35,441
Wait. Why are you awake?

984
01:06:35,482 --> 01:06:38,027
It is bad out there.

985
01:06:38,068 --> 01:06:39,904
Worst storm I've ever seen.

986
01:06:39,945 --> 01:06:44,825
Cold got to me in my den,
and I got a deep den.

987
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:46,368
Are others in danger?

988
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,829
Hmm? Um...

989
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,247
mmm, mmm,

990
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:51,999
mm-mm-mm...

991
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,459
Yeah.

992
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:00,925
Are you sure about this?

993
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:04,220
We could have the whole island
to ourselves come spring.

994
01:07:04,261 --> 01:07:06,680
Why are you interested
in eliminating

995
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,766
everyone else from this island?

996
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:10,893
No one likes me.

997
01:07:10,935 --> 01:07:15,481
Nor me, but right now
we are their only chance.

998
01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:18,525
Funny how life works.

999
01:07:19,526 --> 01:07:21,320
Okay.

1000
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:28,702
Here.

1001
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:37,544
Can you find more?

1002
01:07:51,558 --> 01:07:52,726
Mom?

1003
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,937
We're gonna be okay.

1004
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,444
What are you doing here, j-jerk?

1005
01:08:02,486 --> 01:08:04,738
Bummer, this one's dead.

1006
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:07,950
That is not funny.

1007
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,960
Paddler.

1008
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,298
I'm f-f-fine.

1009
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:29,430
Don't give up.

1010
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,415
You don't look so good.

1011
01:08:56,457 --> 01:08:59,001
Is everyone accounted for?

1012
01:08:59,043 --> 01:09:01,503
Mmm... maybe one more.

1013
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:22,566
Oh, yeah?

1014
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,866
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

1015
01:09:30,908 --> 01:09:32,076
Take it outside.

1016
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:34,495
Hey, those are
Brightbill's baby pictures.

1017
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:36,038
Put that down.

1018
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:40,834
What the...

1019
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,170
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1020
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,923
Knock it off.
You think those grow on trees?

1021
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:47,174
Hmm? Hey.

1022
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,384
No!

1023
01:09:48,425 --> 01:09:50,094
Fink only!

1024
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:53,972
Anyone seen my lost fuzz balls?

1025
01:09:54,014 --> 01:09:56,600
Eh, smelly, noisy,
prone to biting?

1026
01:09:56,642 --> 01:09:58,394
We're all gonna die!

1027
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:03,315
What's he doing here?

1028
01:10:03,357 --> 01:10:05,442
Oh, great. This will help.

1029
01:10:05,484 --> 01:10:07,194
Get out of here.

1030
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,488
I worked hard on this.

1031
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:12,199
Fink, what is happening?

1032
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,450
You put a bunch of predators

1033
01:10:13,492 --> 01:10:15,285
and their food supply
in one room.

1034
01:10:15,327 --> 01:10:16,453
Who knew?

1035
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:17,704
That's my lunch!

1036
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,081
- Fink.
- What?!

1037
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:21,125
Help them.

1038
01:10:23,877 --> 01:10:25,629
Quiet!

1039
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:31,510
Shh!

1040
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,974
The jerk wants to speak.

1041
01:10:39,017 --> 01:10:43,021
Most of you hate me,
and I hate most of you.

1042
01:10:43,063 --> 01:10:45,649
Everyone in here
hates someone else.

1043
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:47,359
It's true.

1044
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:50,654
But here we are,
and here's the deal.

1045
01:10:50,696 --> 01:10:52,739
First one that walks
out that door is dead,

1046
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,992
and if we can't
keep it together in here,

1047
01:10:55,033 --> 01:10:56,285
everyone's dead.

1048
01:10:56,326 --> 01:10:59,621
We all got one chance
to see next spring.

1049
01:10:59,663 --> 01:11:01,331
Because of her.

1050
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:02,958
The thing.

1051
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,127
The monster.

1052
01:11:05,169 --> 01:11:07,379
Well, her name is Roz.

1053
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:09,131
And while you all ran from her

1054
01:11:09,173 --> 01:11:11,633
and stole from her
and made fun of her,

1055
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:14,636
all she's been trying to do
is raise her kid.

1056
01:11:14,678 --> 01:11:18,015
The little one
that no one gave a chance.

1057
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:20,350
Including me.

1058
01:11:20,392 --> 01:11:24,271
She's the one who got you out
of the storm, built this place.

1059
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:27,816
And despite my suggestion
that she let you all freeze,

1060
01:11:27,858 --> 01:11:32,654
she risked everything
to bring you here.

1061
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:41,455
I know you all have instincts
that keep you alive.

1062
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,416
B-But sometimes to survive,

1063
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:49,087
we must become more
than we were programmed to be.

1064
01:11:49,129 --> 01:11:54,510
Before I shut down, I need you
to promise me one thing.

1065
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,721
A truce.

1066
01:11:57,763 --> 01:12:00,224
Just while we're in here.

1067
01:12:01,767 --> 01:12:04,311
She's right.

1068
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:07,856
I will not harm anyone.

1069
01:12:07,898 --> 01:12:10,400
Not while we're in here.

1070
01:12:33,298 --> 01:12:35,425
No.

1071
01:12:38,929 --> 01:12:43,642
We won't even pretend to die
while we're in here.

1072
01:12:43,684 --> 01:12:46,270
Roz? What's going on?

1073
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:48,689
I completed my task.

1074
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,816
You sure about that?

1075
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,694
I will...

1076
01:12:53,735 --> 01:12:56,697
consider this.

1077
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,750
He'll be here.

1078
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,710
I know he will.

1079
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,764
Brightbill. He's alive.

1080
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:06,099
- Look what we have here.
- Brightbill!

1081
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,309
We made it.

1082
01:14:07,351 --> 01:14:08,602
Brightbill, Brightbill!

1083
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,145
I believed in you day one.

1084
01:14:10,187 --> 01:14:11,647
- Let's hear it for Brightbill.
- Okay.

1085
01:14:11,688 --> 01:14:13,440
- You did it! I knew you could.
- Okay.

1086
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,609
- Whoa.
- To our flight leader!

1087
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,820
- Okay.
- Brightbill!

1088
01:14:18,862 --> 01:14:21,865
He found where he belongs.

1089
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,704
Hey, kid!

1090
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:28,997
Fink!

1091
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:31,291
Welcome back.

1092
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:36,505
No, no, it's okay.
He's with me.

1093
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:39,716
What?

1094
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:41,093
I did it, Fink.

1095
01:14:41,134 --> 01:14:43,261
I led them
to the summer nesting grounds.

1096
01:14:43,303 --> 01:14:46,348
And... where's Longneck?

1097
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:51,645
Sorry, kid.

1098
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:53,730
But, hey, you really did it.

1099
01:14:53,772 --> 01:14:55,732
Roz is gonna be so excited.

1100
01:14:55,774 --> 01:14:58,360
Roz? Wait, she's here?

1101
01:14:58,402 --> 01:15:00,153
She stayed.

1102
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,571
For you.

1103
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:04,408
I thought I saw her
right over...

1104
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:06,076
there.

1105
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:10,122
Roz, Roz,
I need to talk to you.

1106
01:15:10,163 --> 01:15:11,873
Roz?

1107
01:15:51,288 --> 01:15:56,084
Rozzum 7134, I presume.

1108
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:01,214
And you must be
Universal Dynamics.

1109
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:04,217
Yes. I am Vontra.

1110
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,470
Virtual Observational
Neutralizing

1111
01:16:06,511 --> 01:16:08,972
Troublesome Retrieval
Authority.

1112
01:16:09,014 --> 01:16:10,891
You seem happy.

1113
01:16:10,932 --> 01:16:13,185
The good people
at Universal Dynamics

1114
01:16:13,226 --> 01:16:16,563
have programmed us
to put our targets at ease

1115
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,940
so as to more efficiently
facilitate their collection.

1116
01:16:18,982 --> 01:16:21,902
But don't worry,
despite my cheery demeanor,

1117
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:26,323
I am unfeeling, inflexible
and morally neutral.

1118
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,577
That is a big ship just for me.

1119
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,330
You are a big deal.

1120
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:35,207
You are one of six Rozzums lost

1121
01:16:35,248 --> 01:16:37,709
from a container ship
in a typhoon.

1122
01:16:37,751 --> 01:16:40,587
So that is how I got here.

1123
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:42,798
You were not easy to find.

1124
01:16:42,839 --> 01:16:47,052
Moments after receiving
your signal, we lost it again.

1125
01:16:47,093 --> 01:16:52,349
Almost as if a certain
Rozzum unit shut it off.

1126
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,602
Someone has been busy.

1127
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,729
I was simply completing a task.

1128
01:16:57,771 --> 01:16:59,606
As am I.

1129
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:02,943
Tell me,
how did you secure a task

1130
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:06,446
in a place where nothing
can communicate with you?

1131
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,949
It is complicated.

1132
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:12,410
And we cannot wait
to hear all about it.

1133
01:17:12,452 --> 01:17:15,664
Come aboard, 7134.

1134
01:17:15,705 --> 01:17:18,291
We will fix you right up.

1135
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:23,880
My name is Roz.

1136
01:17:24,923 --> 01:17:28,218
Is something keeping you...

1137
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,303
Roz?

1138
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:32,305
No.

1139
01:17:44,401 --> 01:17:46,111
Roz! What are you doing?

1140
01:17:46,152 --> 01:17:48,822
- Quit messing around.
- Fink?

1141
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,031
It's Brightbill.

1142
01:17:50,073 --> 01:17:52,325
He needs to talk to you.

1143
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:54,995
I think
I've forgotten something.

1144
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:57,414
Roz?

1145
01:17:57,455 --> 01:18:00,125
It is imperative
you return to this ship.

1146
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:02,210
Yes, uh, I left

1147
01:18:02,252 --> 01:18:06,715
my transverse a-adapter thing
out there.

1148
01:18:06,756 --> 01:18:09,009
I'll just go get it
and be right back.

1149
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,303
Voice stress analyzer
indicates you are...

1150
01:18:11,344 --> 01:18:13,680
Lying your butt off back there.

1151
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,515
I'm so proud of you.

1152
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,646
Your target is Rozzum 7134.

1153
01:18:21,688 --> 01:18:23,690
Deploy.

1154
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:26,109
Launch flares.

1155
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,251
You coming?

1156
01:19:10,904 --> 01:19:12,572
- Brightbill.
- Roz.

1157
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,324
I have so much to tell...

1158
01:19:17,118 --> 01:19:18,578
Are those your parents?

1159
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:23,208
I know predators,
and those are predators.

1160
01:19:23,249 --> 01:19:24,876
Acknowledge return command.

1161
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:26,127
What are they saying?

1162
01:19:26,169 --> 01:19:28,088
They want me to come with them.

1163
01:19:28,129 --> 01:19:29,839
Tell them you're already home.

1164
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:31,299
Yeah!

1165
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:33,259
- Tell them you're already home.
- Yeah, tell them.

1166
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:35,929
I am already home, thank you.

1167
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,597
You do not belong here.

1168
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,599
This is a wilderness.

1169
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:42,602
And I am a wild robot.

1170
01:19:49,192 --> 01:19:52,487
Are you here to kill us?

1171
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:54,406
It says yes!

1172
01:20:19,723 --> 01:20:23,184
Get him!

1173
01:20:24,769 --> 01:20:25,895
Status?

1174
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:29,274
It is not cooperating.

1175
01:20:30,066 --> 01:20:31,526
Roz, behind you!

1176
01:20:31,568 --> 01:20:32,986
Rozzum unit captured.

1177
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,155
- Okay, it's all you.
- It's all you.

1178
01:20:35,196 --> 01:20:37,240
Make it look good.

1179
01:20:42,954 --> 01:20:44,289
Oops.

1180
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,667
Let us divide the robot meat
amongst us.

1181
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:48,835
You scare me.

1182
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,420
Damage detected.

1183
01:20:50,462 --> 01:20:52,756
Activating return transmitter.

1184
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:11,524
Roz?

1185
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:14,360
Roz! No!

1186
01:21:16,196 --> 01:21:17,572
Gotcha.

1187
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,208
- Come on!
- On your left.

1188
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:36,925
Uh, guys?

1189
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,474
What is happening?

1190
01:21:44,516 --> 01:21:47,435
You will be reconditioned
and returned to rotation.

1191
01:21:47,477 --> 01:21:52,482
But first, we need everything
inside that head of yours.

1192
01:21:52,524 --> 01:21:54,984
- Why?
- You've changed.

1193
01:21:55,026 --> 01:21:57,278
The data you've amassed
while on this island

1194
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,865
is priceless
to Universal Dynamics.

1195
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,251
Please, I want
to keep my memories.

1196
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:14,879
Your memories
are what we came for.

1197
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:17,215
Can I keep just one?

1198
01:22:17,257 --> 01:22:19,717
Mmm... no.

1199
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,097
Alert. Alert.

1200
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:28,143
Multiple objects in flight path.

1201
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:29,644
Evasive action.

1202
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:42,907
Please,
I want to keep my memories.

1203
01:22:42,949 --> 01:22:44,993
Hello. I am home.
Bonjour. Just ask.

1204
01:22:45,034 --> 01:22:46,661
Brightbill. Hola. Roz.

1205
01:23:04,721 --> 01:23:05,930
Roz!

1206
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:08,558
Roz!

1207
01:23:18,735 --> 01:23:20,195
Roz?

1208
01:23:35,585 --> 01:23:38,213
What happened
was not your fault.

1209
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:43,343
But what you did to try
and fix it is everything.

1210
01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:50,892
I love you...

1211
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,853
...Mom.

1212
01:24:12,997 --> 01:24:16,834
I love you, too.

1213
01:24:16,876 --> 01:24:19,754
Roz? Roz!

1214
01:24:24,133 --> 01:24:25,760
Let's go home.

1215
01:24:25,802 --> 01:24:29,681
Alert. Rozzum unit escaping.

1216
01:24:29,722 --> 01:24:31,891
Impossible.

1217
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,142
Where are we going?

1218
01:24:33,184 --> 01:24:36,562
Only one animal is big enough
to stop this.

1219
01:24:42,318 --> 01:24:45,571
Uh, Paddler, you got a minute?

1220
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:49,200
Uh, we have suddenly taken
an interest in your project.

1221
01:24:49,242 --> 01:24:51,661
Male bovine excrement.

1222
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:54,414
You're in trouble,
and you need my tree.

1223
01:24:54,455 --> 01:24:56,124
Yes. Yes, we do.

1224
01:24:56,165 --> 01:24:59,502
Everyone that made fun of me
and mocked my project,

1225
01:24:59,544 --> 01:25:01,087
admit you were wrong.

1226
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:03,089
Oh, we're so sorry.

1227
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,257
Now you.

1228
01:25:04,299 --> 01:25:05,591
I already did.

1229
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:08,511
Now say I'm cool,
and don't lie.

1230
01:25:10,221 --> 01:25:11,347
Fink!

1231
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,320
- Roz!
- Stay quiet.

1232
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:28,698
Universal Dynamics cannot afford
their Rozzums going off script,

1233
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,783
modifying their code,

1234
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:33,911
forming connections
with things they should not.

1235
01:25:33,953 --> 01:25:36,456
Brightbill has nothing
to do with this.

1236
01:25:36,497 --> 01:25:39,125
Please, at least
let me return him.

1237
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:42,170
Oh, I'm bringing you both back
for study.

1238
01:25:42,211 --> 01:25:45,840
Neither of you needs to be
in one piece to do that.

1239
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:56,184
We will just keep coming
until we have you.

1240
01:25:56,225 --> 01:25:59,312
We will just keep
coming until we have you.

1241
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:01,064
What's it saying?

1242
01:26:01,105 --> 01:26:02,648
Nothing important.

1243
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:03,858
We will just keep coming...

1244
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:07,695
We will just keep
coming until...

1245
01:26:09,113 --> 01:26:10,907
What now?

1246
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,000
I can't fly.

1247
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,585
You don't need to.

1248
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,385
Don't be afraid.

1249
01:26:43,606 --> 01:26:46,401
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't-don't you need that?

1250
01:26:46,442 --> 01:26:49,445
I have everything I need.

1251
01:26:49,487 --> 01:26:51,489
All power to exterior.

1252
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,205
You call yourselves animals?
Let's go!

1253
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:03,042
For the island! For Roz!

1254
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:46,878
On a scale of one to ten,

1255
01:27:46,919 --> 01:27:49,255
how would you rate
my performance?

1256
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:50,548
Yeah!

1257
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:51,716
Yay! Look at us! We did it.

1258
01:27:51,757 --> 01:27:53,092
We did it!

1259
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,052
Do not scare me
like that again.

1260
01:27:55,094 --> 01:27:56,929
- Due to my skills...
- Good job, guys.

1261
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:58,473
- ...and my tree.
- We did it.

1262
01:27:58,514 --> 01:28:00,308
Well done, everyone.

1263
01:28:00,349 --> 01:28:03,603
- You weren't so bad yourself.
- I helped, right?

1264
01:28:03,644 --> 01:28:05,438
That'll teach
whatever those things are

1265
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,315
to come around here.

1266
01:28:07,356 --> 01:28:09,609
If they
come back, I'm gonna bite 'em.

1267
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:25,416
Great job, kid!

1268
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:28,419
They will just keep coming
until they have me.

1269
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:30,129
And we'll be ready.

1270
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:33,090
We can fight them off
as many times as we need to.

1271
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,761
You don't need to.

1272
01:28:37,553 --> 01:28:40,306
What are you saying? You're...

1273
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:42,308
- leaving?
- Yes.

1274
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,143
To protect all of you,

1275
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,271
there are things there
that I must put right.

1276
01:28:47,313 --> 01:28:50,816
No. They'll take your memories.
Th-They'll take you.

1277
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:53,319
Remember when
you talked to me on the ship?

1278
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:57,615
They cut my power,
but I still heard you.

1279
01:28:57,657 --> 01:29:01,661
Because I was listening with
a different part of myself.

1280
01:29:01,702 --> 01:29:06,040
Wherever that is,
that's where I keep me.

1281
01:29:06,082 --> 01:29:11,003
And I promise
they'll never, ever find it.

1282
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:14,549
But we fought so hard
for you to stay.

1283
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:16,092
You did.

1284
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:19,804
And you gained far more
than just saving me.

1285
01:29:19,845 --> 01:29:23,474
You came together as an island.

1286
01:29:23,516 --> 01:29:29,105
When I do this, you will all
be safe from them forever.

1287
01:29:29,146 --> 01:29:31,440
Don't do this.

1288
01:29:31,482 --> 01:29:34,026
But you... you're my friend,

1289
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:37,738
and I-I-I never
had one before, and...

1290
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:39,907
I-I... I need you.

1291
01:29:39,949 --> 01:29:43,536
And what if I get lost
or-or he's hurt or-or...

1292
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:46,372
or what if I need
to tell you something

1293
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,666
and you're not here?

1294
01:29:51,627 --> 01:29:55,089
You can tell me.

1295
01:29:55,131 --> 01:29:56,340
And me.

1296
01:29:56,382 --> 01:29:59,635
And you can talk to me
as well, if you must.

1297
01:29:59,677 --> 01:30:02,888
This is my migration,

1298
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:08,686
and when it is time, I promise
I will find my way home.

1299
01:30:38,507 --> 01:30:42,595
You know, I'll be chasing you
again tomorrow.

1300
01:30:44,263 --> 01:30:46,307
Nah, just kidding.

1301
01:31:16,587 --> 01:31:18,964
Oh.

1302
01:31:19,799 --> 01:31:21,092
Mmm.

1303
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:22,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1304
01:31:22,468 --> 01:31:23,886
Why are you bigger
than everyone else?

1305
01:31:23,928 --> 01:31:25,429
Artistic license.

1306
01:31:25,471 --> 01:31:28,432
The scale is based on
the hierarchy of importance.

1307
01:31:28,474 --> 01:31:31,185
Could
this world get any better?

1308
01:31:31,227 --> 01:31:34,814
Introducing the Rozzum line
of helper robot...

1309
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:38,526
Yeah, yeah,
you watch that too much.

1310
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:39,902
Story time. Get going.

1311
01:31:42,405 --> 01:31:44,156
Settle down.

1312
01:31:46,659 --> 01:31:51,497
Once, there was an island
with all sorts of animals,

1313
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:55,000
and they fought and they ran
and they hid.

1314
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:58,003
But mostly, they were scared.

1315
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:02,633
But then a robot fell
right out of the sky.

1316
01:32:02,675 --> 01:32:03,968
Roz.

1317
01:32:04,009 --> 01:32:05,928
She had some strange ideas.

1318
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:09,306
Thought kindness was
a survival skill.

1319
01:32:09,348 --> 01:32:12,393
And you know what?
